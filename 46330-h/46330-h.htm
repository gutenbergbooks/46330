<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Hegel's "<i>Æsthetik</i>," or "Philosophy of Fine Art,"
is a work which should no longer be inaccessible to
the English reading public, but the reproduction
of which, in its complete form of 1600 pages, is a
task not to be lightly undertaken. I know of three
partial reproductions of the "<i>Æsthetik</i>" in English,
viz. Mr. Bryant's translation of Part II.,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr.
Kedney's short analysis of the entire work,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
Mr. Hastie's translation of Michelet's short "Philosophy
of Art,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> prefaced by Hegel's Introduction,
partly translated and partly analysed.</p>

<p>I wholly disapprove of analyses (among which
may be reckoned Michelet's summary above mentioned)
as representations of Hegel's writing, which
is attractive chiefly by the force and freshness of
its detail. I am convinced that Hegel should be
allowed to speak for himself, and that failing the
translation of the whole "<i>Æsthetik</i>," or of very
copious selections, the best course is that which
I have adopted in the present volume, viz. to translate
the entire Introduction, including the chapter
entitled, "Division of the Subject." This Introduction
is in Hegel's best manner&mdash;so far as he can
be said to have literary manner at all, especially
in a work which has been produced by editors from
lecture-notes,&mdash;and is tolerably complete in itself.
It is not contained as a whole in any of the above-mentioned
works. I ought to say, however, that
Mr. Hastie's translation is excellent in style; but
after the first thirty-four pages it also becomes an
analysis. Nor is it wholly free from serious mistakes.
I have hoped that the present volume may be of
interest to many who, without being students of philosophy,
are intelligent lovers of art. I have therefore
done my best to <i>interpret</i> philosophical expressions,
instead of merely furnishing their technical equivalents.
I have also added a few short notes, either
to explain literary allusions, or to complete the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
interpretation of technical terms. The prefatory essay
was written with a similar intention, not as original
speculation, but as an assistance to general readers
in apprehending the point of view from which Fine
Art is regarded by Hegel and kindred writers.</p>

<p>I have broken up the "<i>Einleitung</i>," or Introduction
proper, which is continuous in the original, into
four chapters,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> hoping that the arrangement of the
discussion may be thus rendered easier to follow.
The "<i>Eintheilung</i>," which forms my Chapter V., is
a separate chapter in the original. The table of
contents is translated from the original, excepting
those portions of it which are enclosed in square
brackets, [ ].</p>

<p>My literary notes are entirely borrowed from the
late Mrs. F. C. Conybeare's translation of Scherer's
"History of German Literature;" a work invaluable
to the English student, whose gratitude must for
long be saddened by the untimely death of the
translator.</p>

<h2>PREFATORY ESSAY BY THE TRANSLATOR.</h2>

<p class="center">ON THE TRUE CONCEPTION OF ANOTHER WORLD.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With such barren forms of thought, that are always in a
world beyond, Philosophy has nothing to do. Its object
always something concrete, and in the highest sense present."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hegel's</span>
<i>Logic</i>, Wallace's translation, p. 150.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will surprise many readers to be told that the
words which I have quoted above embody the very
essence of Hegelian thought. The Infinite, the supra-sensuous,
the divine, are so connected in our minds
with futile rackings of the imagination about remote
matters which only distract us from our duties, that
a philosophy which designates its problems by such
terms as these seems self-condemned as cloudy and
inane. But, all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding,
Hegel is faithful to the present and the
concrete. In the study of his philosophy we are
always dealing with human experience. "My stress
lay," says Mr. Browning,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "on the incidents in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
development of a soul; little else is worth study."
For "a soul" read "the mind," and you have the
subject-matter to which Hegel's eighteen close-printed
volumes are devoted. The present introductory
remarks are meant to insist on this neglected
point of view. I wish to point out, in two or three
salient instances, the transformation undergone by
speculative notions when sedulously applied to life,
and restrained from generating an empty "beyond."
By so doing I hope to pave the way for a due
appreciation of Hegel's philosophy of fine art. That
the world of mind, or the world above sense, exists
as an actual and organized whole, is a truth most
easily realized in the study of the beautiful. And to
grasp this principle as Hegel applies it is nothing
less than to acquire a new contact with spiritual
life. The spiritual world, which is present, actual,
and concrete, contains much besides beauty. But
to apprehend one element of such a whole constitutes
and presupposes a long step towards apprehending
the rest. It is for this reason that I propose, in the
first place, to explain, by prominent examples, the
conception of a spiritual world which is present and
actual, and then to let Hegel speak for himself on
the particular sphere of art. So closely connected
indeed are all the embodiments of mind, that the
Introduction to the "Philosophy of Fine Art" is
almost a microcosm of his entire system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>

<p>We know, to our cost, the popular conception of
the supra-sensuous world. Whatever that world is,
it is, as commonly thought of, not here and not now.
That is to say, if here and now, it is so by a sort of
miracle, at which we are called upon to wonder, as
when angels are said to be near us, or the dead to
know what we do. Again, it is a counterpart of our
present world, and rather imperceptible to <i>our</i>
senses, than in its nature beyond contact with sense
as such. It is peopled by persons, who live eternally,
which means through endless ages, and to whose
actual communion with us, as also to our own with
God, we look forward in the future. It even perhaps
contains a supra-sensuous original corresponding to
every thing and movement in this world of ours.
And it does <i>not</i> necessarily deepen our conception
of life, but only reduplicates it.</p>

<p>Such a world, whatever we may think about its
actual existence, is <i>not</i> the "other world" of philosophy.
The "things not seen" of Plato or of Hegel
are not a double or a projection of the existing
world. Plato, indeed, wavered between the two
conceptions in a way that should have warned his
interpreters of the divergence in his track of thought.
But in Hegel, at least, there is no ambiguity. The
world of spirits with him is no world of ghosts.
When we study the embodiments of mind or spirit
in his pages, and read of law, property, and national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
unity; of fine art, the religious community, and the
intellect that has attained scientific self-consciousness,
we may miss our other world with its obscure
"beyond," but we at any rate feel ourselves to be
dealing with something real, and with the deepest
concerns of life. We may deny to such matters the
titles which philosophy bestows upon them; we
may say that this is no "other world," no realm of
spirits, nothing infinite or divine: but this matters
little so long as we know what we are talking about,
and are talking about the best we know. And what
we discuss when Hegel is our guide, will <i>always</i>
be some great achievement or essential attribute of
the human mind. He never asks, "Is it?" but always
"What is it?" and therefore has instruction, drawn
from experience, even for those to whom the titles of
his inquiries seem fraudulent or bombastic.</p>

<p>These few remarks are not directed to maintaining
any thesis about the reality of nature and of
sense. Their object is to enforce a distinction which
falls <i>within</i> the world which we know, and not
<i>between</i> the world we know and another which we
do not know. This distinction is real, and governs
life. I am not denying any other distinction, but
I am insisting on this. No really great philosopher,
nor religious teacher,&mdash;neither Plato, nor Kant, nor
St. Paul&mdash;can be understood unless we grasp this
antithesis in the right way. All of these teachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
have pointed men to another world. All of them,
perhaps, were led at times by the very force and
reality of their own thought into the fatal separation
that cancels its meaning. So strong was their
sense of the gulf between the trifles and the realities
of life, that they gave occasion to the indolent
imagination&mdash;in themselves and in others&mdash;to
transmute this gulf from a measure of moral effort
into an inaccessibility that defies apprehension.
But their purpose was to overcome this inaccessibility,
not to heighten it.</p>

<p>The hardest of all lessons in interpretation is to
believe that great men mean what they say. We
are below their level, and what they actually say
seems impossible to us, till we have adulterated it
to suit our own imbecility. Especially when they
speak of the highest realities, we attach <i>our</i> notion
of reality to what <i>they</i> pronounce to be real. And
thus we baffle every attempt to deepen our ideas of
the world in which we live. The work of intelligence
is hard; that of the sensuous fancy is easy; and so
we substitute the latter for the former. We are told,
for instance, by Plato, that goodness, beauty, and
truth are realities, but not visible or tangible.
Instead of responding to the call so made on our
intelligence by scrutinizing the nature and conditions
of these intellectual facts&mdash;though we know well how
tardily they are produced by the culture of ages&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
apply forthwith our idea of reality as something
separate in space and time, and so "refute" Plato
with ease, and remain as wise as we were before.
And it is true that Plato, handling ideas of vast
import with the mind and language of his day,
sometimes by a similar error refutes himself.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He
makes, for instance, the disembodied soul see the
invisible ideas. Thus he travesties his things of the
mind as though they were things of sense, only not of
<i>our</i> sense&mdash;thereby destroying the deeper difference
of kind that alone enables them to find a place in
our world. That his doctrine of ideas was really
rooted, not in mysticism, but in scientific enthusiasm,
is a truth that is veiled from us partly by his
inconsistencies, but far more by our own erroneous
preconceptions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There is, however, a genuine distinction between
"this" world and the "other" world, which is merely
parodied by the vulgar antitheses between natural
and supernatural, finite and infinite, phenomenal
and noumenal. We sometimes hear it said, "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
world is quite changed to me since I knew such a
person," or "studied such a subject," or "had suggested
to me such an idea." The expression may be
literally true; and we do not commonly exaggerate,
but vastly underrate its import. We read, for
instance, in a good authority, "These twenty kinds
of birds (which Virgil mentions) do not correspond
so much to our species as to our genera; for the
Greeks and Romans, I need hardly say, had only
very rough-and-ready methods of classification, just
as is the case with uneducated people at the present
day."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Any one may verify the same fact as regards
the observation of flowers. Every yellow ranunculus
is called a "butter-cup," every large white umbellifer
a "hemlock." These, with hundreds of other
differences of perception, affect the surroundings in
which men consciously live, at least as much as a
considerable degree of deafness or blindness. It is
no metaphor, but literal fact, to say that man's whole
environment is transformed by the training even of
his mere apprehension of natural objects. But there
is more in the matter than this. Without going into
metaphysics, which I wish to avoid, I cannot, indeed,
maintain that mind "makes" natural objects, although
by enabling us to perceive them it unquestionably
makes our immediate conscious world. My individual
consciousness does not make or create the differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
between the species of ranunculus, although it does
create my knowledge of them. But when we come
to speak of the world of morals or art or politics,
we may venture much further in our assertions. The
actual facts of this world do directly arise out of and
are causally sustained by conscious intelligence; and
these facts form the world above sense. The unity
of a Christian church or congregation is a governing
fact of life; so is that of a family or a nation; so, we
may hope, will that of humanity come to be. What
is this unity? Is it visible and tangible, like the
unity of a human body? No, the unity is "ideal;"
that is, it exists in the medium of thought only; it
is made up of certain sentiments, purposes, and ideas.
What even of an army? Here, too, an ideal
unity is the mainspring of action. Without mutual
intelligence and reciprocal reliance you may have
a mob, but you cannot have an army. But all these
conditions exist and can exist in the mind only. An
army, <i>qua</i> army, is not a mere fact of sense; for not
only does it need mind to perceive it&mdash;a heap of sand
does that&mdash;but it also needs mind to <i>make</i> it.</p>

<p>The world of these governing facts of life is the
world of the things not seen, the object of reason,
the world of the truly infinite and divine. It is, of
course, a false antithesis to contrast seeing with the
bodily eye and seeing with the mind's eye. The
seeing eye is always the mind's eye. The distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
between sense and spirit or intellect is a distinction
<i>within the mind</i> just as is St. Paul's opposition
between the spirit and the flesh. Nevertheless, the
mind that only sees colour&mdash;sense or sense-perception&mdash;is
different from the mind that sees beauty, the
self-conscious spirit. The latter includes the former,
but the former does not include the latter. To the
one the colour is the ultimate fact; to the other it
is an element in a thing of beauty. This relation
prevails throughout between the world of sense and
the world above sense. The "things not seen,"
philosophically speaking, are no world of existences
or of intelligences co-ordinate with and severed from
this present world. They are a value, an import,
a significance, superadded to the phenomenal world,
which may thus be said, though with some risk of
misunderstanding, to be degraded into a symbol.
The house, the cathedral, the judge's robe, the
general's uniform, are ultimate facts for the child or
the savage; but for the civilized man they are
symbols of domestic life, of the Church, and of the
State. Even where the supra-sensuous world has
its purest expression, in the knowledge and will of
intelligent beings, it presupposes a sensuous world
as the material of ideas and of actions. "This" world
and the "other" world are continuous and inseparable,
and all men must live in some degree for both. But
the completion of the Noumenal world, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
apprehension of its reality and completeness, is the
task by fulfilling which humanity advances.</p>

<p>I pass to the interpretation, neither technical nor
controversial, of one or two of Hegel's most alarming
phrases.</p>

<p>The "infinite" seems to practical minds the very
opposite of anything real, present, or valuable. As
the description of life, it is the mere negation of the
life we know; as the description of a purpose, it is
the very antithesis of any purpose that we can conceive
to be attainable; as the description of a being,
it appears to be formed by denying every predicate
which we attach to personality. And I could wish
that Hegel had not selected this much-abused term
as the distinctive predicate of what is most real and
most precious in life. He adhered to it, no doubt,
because his infinity, though different in nature to that
of common logic, yet rightly fills the place and meets
the problem of that conception. I will attempt to
explain how this can be, and what we are discussing
when we read about infinity in the Hegelian philosophy.</p>

<p>It is an obvious remark, that infinity was a symbol
of evil in Hellenic speculation, whereas to Christian
and modern thought it is identified with good. Much
idle talk has arisen on this account, as to the limitation
of the Hellenic mind. For in fact, the Finite
ascribed to Pythagoras, and the idea of limit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
proportion in Plato or in Aristotle, are far more nearly
akin to true infinity than is the Infinite of modern
popular philosophy. Infinite means the negation of
limit. Now, common infinity, which may be identified
in general with enumeration <i>ad infinitum</i>,&mdash;the <i>false</i>
infinity of Hegel&mdash;is the attempt to negate or transcend
a limit which inevitably recurs. It arises from attempting
a task or problem in the wrong way, so that we
may go on for ever without making any advance
towards its achievement. All quantitative infinity&mdash;which
of course has its definite uses, subject to proper
reservations&mdash;is of this nature. A process does not
change its character by mere continuance, and the
aggregate of a million units is no more free from
limitation than the aggregate of ten. A defect in
kind cannot be compensated by mere quantity. We
see the fallacious attempt in savage, barbaric, or
vulgar art. Meaningless iteration, objectless labour,
enormous size, extravagant costliness, indicate the
effort to satisfy man's need of expression by the mere
accumulation of work without adequate idea or purpose.
But such efforts, however stupendous, never
attain their goal. They constitute a recurrent failure
to transcend a recurrent limit, precisely analogous
to enumeration <i>ad infinitum</i>. A hundred thousand
pounds' worth of bricks and mortar comes no nearer
to the embodiment of mind than a thousand pounds'
worth. To attempt adequate expression by mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
aggregation of cost or size is therefore to fall into the
infinite process or the false infinity.</p>

<p>Another well-known instance is the pursuit of
happiness in the form of "pleasure for pleasure's
sake." The recurrence of unchanging units leaves us
where we were. A process which does not change
remains the same, and if it did not bring satisfaction
at first, will not do so at last.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We might as well go
on producing parallels to infinity, in the hope that
somehow or somewhere they may meet. An infinite
straight line may serve as a type of the kind of
infinity we are considering.</p>

<p>Infinity in the Hegelian sense does not partake
in any way of this endlessness, or of the unreality which
attaches to it. Its root-idea is self-completeness or satisfaction.
That which is "infinite" is without boundary,
because it does not refer beyond itself for explanation,
or for justification; and therefore, in all human existence
or production infinity can only be an aspect or element.
A picture, for instance, regarded as a work of fine
art, justifies itself, gives satisfaction directly and without
raising questions of cause or of comparison, and
is in this sense&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in respect of its beauty&mdash;regarded
as "infinite." When, on the other hand, we consider
this same work of art as an historical phenomenon, as
a link in a chain of causation&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> as elucidating the
development of a school, or proving the existence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
a certain technical process at a certain date&mdash;then we
go beyond itself for its interest and explanation, and
depress it at once into a finite object. The finite is
that which presents itself as incomplete; the infinite
that which presents itself as complete, and which,
therefore, does not force upon us the fact of its limitation.
This character belongs in the highest degree
to self-conscious mind, as realized in the world above
sense; and in some degree to all elements of that
world&mdash;for instance, to the State&mdash;in as far as they
represent man's realized self-consciousness. It is the
nature of self-consciousness to be infinite, because it
is its nature to take into itself what was opposed to
it, and thus to make itself into an organized sphere
that has value and reality within, and not beyond
itself. If false infinity was represented by an infinite
straight line, true infinity may be compared to a
circle or a sphere.</p>

<p>The distinction between true and false infinity is
of the profoundest moral import. The sickly yearning
that longs only to escape from the real, rooted
in the antithesis between the infinite and the actual
or concrete, or in the idea of the monotonous "<i>infini</i>"
which is one with the "<i>abîme</i>" or the "<i>gouffre</i>," is
appraised by this test at its true value. It is seen
to rest on a mere pathetic fallacy of thought and
sentiment. So far from the infinite being remote,
abstract, unreal, nothing but the infinite can be truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
present, concrete, and real. The finite always refers
us away and away through an endless series of causes,
of effects, or of relations. The infinite is individual,
and bears the character of knowledge, achievement,
attainment. In short, the actual realities which we
have in mind when, in philosophy, we speak of the
infinite, are such as a nation that is conscious of its
unity and general will, or the realm of fine art as
the recognition of man's higher nature, or the religious
community with its conviction of an indwelling Deity.</p>

<p>Now, whether we like the term Infinite or not,
whether or no we think that man's life can be explained
and justified within the limits of these aims
and these phenomena, there is no doubt that these
matters are real, and are the most momentous of
realities. In acquainting ourselves with their structure,
evolution, and relation to individual life, we are
at least not wasting time, nor treating of matters
beyond human intelligence.</p>

<p>There is a very similar contrast in the conception
of human Freedom. "Free will" is so old a vexed
question, that though the conflict still rages fitfully
round it, the world hardly conceives that much can
turn upon its decision. But when in place of the
abstract, "Is man free?" we are confronted with the
concrete inquiry, "When, in what, and as what, does
man carry out his will with least hindrance and with
fullest satisfaction?" then we have before us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
actual phenomena of civilization, instead of an idle
and abstract Yes or No.</p>

<p>Man's Freedom, in the sense thus contemplated,
lies in the spiritual or supra-sensuous world by which
his humanity is realized, and in which his will finds
fulfilment. The family, for example, property, and
law are the first steps of man's freedom. In them
the individual's will obtains and bestows recognition
as an agent in a society whose bond of union is ideal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
existing only in consciousness; and this recognition
develops into duties and rights. It is in these
that man finds something to live for, something in
which and for the sake of which to assert himself.
As society develops he lives on the whole more in
the civilized or spiritual world, and less in the savage
or purely natural world. His will, which is himself,
expands with the institutions and ideas that form
its purpose, and the history of this expansion is the
history of human freedom. Nothing is more shallow,
more barbarously irrational, than to regard the progress
of civilization as the accumulation of restrictions.
Laws and rules are a necessary aspect of
extended capacities. Every power that we gain has
a positive nature, and therefore involves positive
conditions, and every positive condition has negative
relations. To accomplish a particular purpose you
must go to work in a particular way, and in no other
way. To complain of this is like complaining of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
house because it has a definite shape. If freedom
means absence of attributes, empty space is "freer"
than any edifice. Of course a house may be so ugly
that we may say we would rather have none at all.
Civilization may bring such horrors that we may
say "rather savagery than this;" but in neither case
are we serious. Great as are the vices of civilization,
it is only in civilization that man becomes human,
spiritual, and free.</p>

<p>The effort to grasp and apply such an idea as
this can hardly be barren. It brings us face to face
with concrete facts of history, and of man's actual
motives and purposes. True philosophy here, as
everywhere, plunges into the concrete and the real;
it is the indolent abstract fancy that thrusts problems
away into the remote "beyond" or into futile abstraction.
Plato, the philosopher, knows well that the
mind is free when it achieves what as a whole it truly
wills. But Plato, the allegorist and imaginative
preacher, refers the soul's freedom to a fleeting
moment of ante-natal choice, which he vainly strives
to exempt from causal influence. Pictorial imagination,
with its ready reference to occurrences in past
and future, is the great foe to philosophic intelligence.</p>

<p>Finally, it is impossible to omit all reference to
the notion of an immanent Deity, which forms the
very centre of Hegel's thought. When an unspeculative
English reader first meets with Hegel's passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
insistence that God is not unknowable, that He
necessarily reveals himself as a Trinity of persons,
and that to deny this is to represent men as "the
heathen who know not God," he feels as if he had
taken sand into his mouth. He is inclined to ask
what these Neo-Platonic or mediæval doctrines are
doing in the nineteenth century, and why we should
resuscitate dead logomachies that can have no
possible value for life or conduct. Now, I must
not attempt here to discuss the difficult question of
Hegel's ultimate conception of the being of God,
and I am bound to warn any one who may read
these pages that I only profess to reproduce one&mdash;though
by far the most prominent&mdash;side of that
conception. But, subject to this reservation, I have
no hesitation in saying, that our own prejudices form
the only hindrance to our seeing that Hegel's subject-matter
is here, as elsewhere, human life. He gives
us what he takes to be the literal truth, and we will
have it to be metaphor. Verbally contradicting
Kant, he accepts, completes, and enforces Kant's
thought. "Revelation can never be the true ground
of religion," said Kant; "for revelation is an historical
accident, and religion is a rational necessity of man's
intelligent nature." "Revelation is the only true knowledge
of God and ground of religion," says Hegel,
"because <i>revelation consists in the realization of God in
man's intelligent nature</i>." We are, however, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
unaccustomed to such phrases, and our imagination is
equal to its habitual task of evading their meaning.
We take them to be a strong metaphor, meaning
that God, who is a sort of ghostly being a long way
off, is, notwithstanding, more or less within the knowledge
of our minds, and so is "in" them, as a book
which is actually in London may be in my memory
when I am in Scotland. Now, right or wrong, this
is not what Hegel means. He means what he says;
that God is spirit or mind,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and exists in the medium
of mind, <i>which is actual as intelligence, for us at any
rate, only in the human self-consciousness</i>. The
thought is hard from its very simplicity, and we
struggle, as always, to avoid grasping it. We imagine
spirits as made of a sort of thin matter, and so as
existing just like bodies, although we call them disembodied.
And then we think of this disembodied
form as an alternative to human form, and suppose
spirit to have somehow a purer existence apart from
human body. This error really springs from imagining
the two as existences of the same kind, and
so conflicting, and from not realizing the notion of
spirit as mind or self-consciousness, which is the only
way of conceiving its actual presence in our world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>
<p>Mind uses sensuous existence as its symbol; perhaps
even needs it. The poet who has hit Hegel's thought
so nearly,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> fails here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line-indent">"This weight of body and limb,</div>
<div class="line">Are they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him?"</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here we leave the track of the higher Pantheism
for that of vulgar mysticism. Spiritual being is
conceived as somehow incompatible with bodily
shape, either because incapable of any concrete
embodiment, or because it has a quasi-material shape
of its own. Now, this is just the reverse of the
Hegelian idea. According to Hegel, it is only in the
human form that intelligence can for us find its full
expression. The notion of a spiritual body other
than and incompatible with the natural body does
not arise. Spirit exists in the medium of consciousness,
not in a peculiar kind of matter. The spiritualization
of the natural body is not to be looked for in
an astral or angel body, but in the gait and gesture,
the significance and dignity, that make the body of
the civilized man the outward image of his soul, and
distinguish him from the savage as from the animal.
The human soul becomes actual itself, and visible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
others, only by moulding the body into its symbol
and instrument. It ought to have been an axiom of
physiology, Hegel says, that the series of animated
forms must necessarily lead up to that of man. For
this is the only sensuous form in which mind could
attain adequate manifestation. Thus anthropomorphism
in fine art is no accident, nor an unworthy
portrayal of divinity. If the Deity is to be symbolized
to sense, it must be in the image of man. The
symbol is not indeed the reality, as the sensuous
image is not conscious thought; but this is a defect
inherent in artistic presentation, and not attributable
to anthropomorphism in particular.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in the light of such a conception,
a speculative import can be attached to the doctrine
of the Incarnation, and Hegel's reading of Christian
ideas is, in fact, to be interpreted entirely in this
sense. This is not the place to go deeper into such
views, which, however profound, may perhaps continue
to seem non-natural expositions of Christian dogma.
I am only concerned to show how here, also, the
speculative idea, operating upon the concrete and
actual, generates a fresh and inspiring insight into
life and conduct. Few chapters of anthropology are
more thorough, profound, and suggestive than Hegel's
account of the "actual soul;" <i>i.e.</i> of the habits and
attributes which make the body distinctively human
by stamping it with the impress of mind. Nor has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
philosophic insight ever done better service to the
history of religion than in grasping the essence of
Christianity as the <i>unity</i>, (not merely the <i>union</i>) of the
divine and human nature.</p>

<p>Among the things which are spiritually discerned,
an important place belongs to beauty. As a boundary
and transition between sense and thought, it
is peculiarly fitted to illustrate the reality which we
claim, in contradistinction to mere sensuous appearance,
for what is best in life. Many who distrust
Hegelian formulæ are convinced that beauty at least
is real. They will admit that fine art and the recognition
of beauty are not trifles, not amusements, but
rank high among the interests that give life its value.
All such will find themselves in sympathy with the
purpose of a great philosopher who has bent all the
power of his genius and his industry to vindicating
a place for art as an embodiment of the divine nature.
The Introduction to Hegel's "Æsthetic," which is all
that it was possible to reproduce in the present volume,
lacks, of course, the solidity and detailed elaboration
of the treatise. Yet to all who care for thorough and
noble thought on a great subject, and for a defence
of their faith in the true spiritual realities, I have
hope that the ensuing pages, however marred by
imperfect translation, will be welcome.</p>

<p>The present course of lectures deals with "Æsthetic."
Their subject is the wide <i>realm of the beautiful</i>, and,
more particularly, their province is <i>Art</i>&mdash;we may
restrict it, indeed, to <i>Fine Art</i>.</p>

<p>The name "Æsthetic" in its natural sense is
not quite appropriate to this subject. "Æsthetic"
means more precisely the science of sensation or
feeling. Thus understood, it arose as a new science,
or rather as something that was to become a branch
of philosophy for the first time,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the school of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Wolff, at the epoch when works of art were being
considered in Germany in the light of the feelings
which they were supposed to evoke&mdash;feelings of
pleasure, admiration, fear, pity, etc. The name was
so inappropriate, or, strictly speaking, so superficial,
that for this reason it was attempted to form other
names, <i>e.g.</i> "Kallistic." But this name, again, is
unsatisfactory, for the science to be designated does
not treat of beauty in general, but merely of <i>artistic</i>
beauty. We shall, therefore, permit the name
Æsthetic to stand, because it is nothing but a name,
and so is indifferent to us, and, moreover, has up to
a certain point passed into common language. As
a name, therefore, it may be retained. The proper
expression, however, for our science is the "Philosophy of
Art," or, more definitely, the "Philosophy of Fine Art."</p>

<p>&alpha;. By the above expression we at once exclude
the <i>beauty of Nature</i>. Such a limitation of our
subject may appear to be an arbitrary demarcation,
resting on the principle that every science has the
prerogative of marking out its boundaries at pleasure.
But this is not the sense in which we are to understand
the limitation of Æsthetic to <i>the beauty of art</i>.
It is true that in common life we are in the habit of
speaking of beautiful colour, a beautiful sky, a beautiful
river, and, moreover, of beautiful flowers, beautiful
animals, and, above all, of beautiful human beings.
We will not just now enter into the controversy how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
far such objects can justly have the attribute of
beauty ascribed to them, or how far, speaking
generally, natural beauty ought to be recognized as
existing besides artistic beauty. We may, however,
begin at once by asserting that artistic beauty stands
<i>higher</i> than nature. For the beauty of art is the
beauty that is born&mdash;born again, that is&mdash;of the
mind;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and by as much as the mind and its products
are higher than nature and its appearances, by so
much the beauty of art is higher than the beauty of
nature. Indeed, if we look at it <i>formally</i>&mdash;i.e. only
considering in what way it exists, not what there is
in it,&mdash;even a silly fancy such as may pass through
a man's head is <i>higher</i> than any product of nature;
for such a fancy must at least be characterized by
intellectual being and by freedom.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In respect of
its content, on the other hand, the sun, for instance,
appears to us to be an absolutely necessary factor in
the universe, while a blundering notion passes away
as accidental and transient; but yet, in its own being,
a natural existence such as the sun is indifferent,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
not free or self-conscious, while if we consider it in
its necessary connection with other things we are not
regarding it by itself or for its own sake, and, therefore,
not as beautiful.</p>

<p>To say, as we have said, in general terms, that
mind and its artistic beauty stand <i>higher</i> than natural
beauty, is no doubt to determine almost nothing. For
"higher" is an utterly indefinite expression, which
designates the beauty of nature and that of art as
if merely standing side by side in the space of the
imagination, and states the difference between them
as purely quantitative, and, therefore, purely external.
But the mind and its artistic beauty, in being "<i>higher</i>"
as compared with nature, have a distinction which is
not simply relative. Mind, and mind only, is capable
of truth, and comprehends in itself all that is, so that
whatever is beautiful can only be really and truly
beautiful as partaking in this higher element and as
created thereby. In this sense the beauty of nature
reveals itself as but a reflection of the beauty which
belongs to the mind, as an imperfect, incomplete
mode of being, as a mode whose really substantial
element is contained in the mind itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, we shall find the restriction to fine art
very natural, for however much has been and is said&mdash;though
less by the ancients than by ourselves&mdash;of
the beauties of nature, yet no one has taken it
into his head to emphasize the point of view of the
<i>beauty</i> of natural objects, and to attempt to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
science, a systematic account of these beauties. The
aspect of <i>Utility</i>, indeed, has been accentuated, and
a science, <i>e.g.</i> of natural things useful against diseases
a <i>materia medica</i>, has been compiled, consisting in a
description of minerals, chemical products, plants, and
animals that are of use for curative purposes. But
the realm of nature has not been arrayed and
estimated under the aspect of beauty. In dealing
with natural beauty we find ourselves too open to
<i>vagueness</i>, and too destitute of a <i>criterion</i>; for which
reason such a review would have little interest.</p>

<p>The above prefatory remarks upon beauty in
nature and in art, upon the relation between the
two, and the exclusion of the former from the region
of the subject proper, are meant to remove any idea
that the limitation of our science is owing merely to
choice and to caprice. But this is not the place to
<i>demonstrate</i> the above relation, for the consideration
of it falls within our science itself, and therefore it
cannot be discussed and demonstrated till later.</p>

<p>Supposing that for the present we have limited
ourselves to the beauty of art, this first step brings
us at once into contact with fresh difficulties.</p>

<p>&beta;. The first thing that may suggest itself to
us is the difficulty whether fine art shows itself to
<i>deserve</i> a scientific treatment. Beauty and art, no
doubt, pervade all the business of life like a kindly
genius, and form the bright adornment of all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
surroundings, both mental and material, soothing the
sadness of our condition and the embarrassments
of real life, killing time in entertaining fashion, and
where there is nothing good to be achieved, occupying
the place of what is vicious, better, at any rate, than
vice. Yet although art presses in with its pleasing
shapes on every possible occasion, from the rude
adornments of the savage to the splendour of the
temple with its untold wealth of decoration, still
these shapes themselves appear to fall outside the
real purposes of life. And even if the creations of
art do not prove detrimental to our graver purposes,
if they appear at times actually to further them by
keeping evil at a distance, still it is so far true
that art belongs rather to the relaxation and leisure
of the mind, while the substantive interests of life
demand its exertion. Hence it may seem unsuitable
and pedantic to treat with scientific seriousness what
is not in itself of a serious nature. In any case, upon
such a view art appears as a superfluity, even if the
softening of the mental temper which preoccupation
with beauty has power to produce, does not turn out
a detrimental, because effeminating influence. In
this aspect of the matter, the fine arts being granted
to be a <i>luxury</i>, it has been thought necessary in
various ways to take up their defence with reference
to their relation towards <i>practical</i> necessities, and
more especially towards morality and piety; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it is impossible to demonstrate their harmlessness,
at least to make it credible that the mental luxury in
question afforded a larger sum of <i>advantages</i> than of
<i>disadvantages</i>. With this view very serious aims have
been ascribed to art, and it has been recommended in
various ways as a mediator between reason and
sensuousness, between inclination and duty, as the
reconciler of these elements in the obstinate conflict
and repulsion which their collision generates. But
the opinion may be maintained that, assuming such
aims of art, more serious though they are, nothing
is gained for reason and duty by the attempt
at mediation, because these principles, as essentially
incapable of intermixture, can be parties to no such
compromise, but demand in their manifestation the
same purity which they have in themselves. And it
might be said that art itself is not made any more
worthy of scientific discussion by such treatment,
seeing that it is still doubly a servant&mdash;to higher
aims, no doubt, on the one hand, but none the less
to vacuity and frivolity on the other; and in such
service can at best only display itself as a means,
instead of being an end pursued for its own sake.
Finally, art, considered as a means, seems to labour
under this defect of form, that, supposing it to be
subordinated to serious ends, and to produce results
of importance, still the means employed by art for
such purposes is <i>deception</i>. For beauty has its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in appearance.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Now, it will readily be admitted that
an aim which is real and true in itself ought not to
be attained by deception, and if it does here and
there achieve some success in this way, that can
only be the case to a limited extent, and even then
deception cannot approve itself as the right means.
For the means should correspond to the dignity of
the end, and only what is real and true, not semblance
or deception, has power to create what is real and
true; just as science, for instance, has to consider
the true interests of the mind in accordance with
the truth of reality and the true way of conceiving it.</p>

<p>In all these respects it may appear as if fine art
were <i>unworthy</i> of scientific consideration; because,
as is alleged, it is at best a pleasing amusement, and
even if it pursues more serious aims is in contradiction
with their nature, but is at best the mere servant
alike of amusement and of serious aims, and yet has
at command, whether as the element of its being or
as the vehicle of its action, nothing beyond deception
and semblance.</p>

<p>&gamma;. But, in the second place, it is a still more probable
aspect of the question that, even if fine art were
to form a subject of philosophical reflections in a general
way, it would be no <i>appropriate</i> matter for strictly
scientific treatment. The beauty of art presents itself
to sense, to feeling, to perception, to imagination; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
sphere is not that of thought, and the apprehension
of its activity and its productions demand another
organ than that of the scientific intelligence. Moreover,
what we enjoy in the beauty of art is precisely
the <i>freedom</i> of its productive and plastic energy. In
the origination, as in the contemplation, of its creations
we appear to escape wholly from the fetters of
rule and regularity. In the forms of art we seek for
repose and animation in place of the austerity of the
reign of law and the sombre self-concentration of
thought; we would exchange the shadowland of the
idea for cheerful vigorous reality. And lastly, the
source of artistic creations is the free activity of fancy,
which in her imagination is more free than nature's
self. Not only has art at command the whole wealth
of natural forms in the brilliant variety of their appearance,
but also the creative imagination has power
to expatiate inexhaustibly beyond their limit in products
of <i>its own</i>. It may be supposed that, in presence
of this immeasurable abundance of inspiration and
its free creations, thought will necessarily lose the
courage to bring them <i>completely</i> before it, to criticize
them, and to array them under its universal formulæ.</p>

<p>Science, on the contrary, every one admits, is compelled
by its form to busy itself with thought which
abstracts from the mass of particulars. For this reason,
on the one hand, imagination with its contingency
and caprice&mdash;that is, the organ of artistic activity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
enjoyment&mdash;is of necessity excluded from science.
And on the other hand, seeing that art is what cheers
and animates the dull and withered dryness of the
idea, reconciles with reality its abstraction and its dissociation
therefrom, and supplies out of the real world
what is lacking to the notion, it follows, we may think,
that a <i>purely</i> intellectual treatment of art destroys
this very means of supplementation, annihilates it,
and reduces the idea once more to its simplicity
devoid of reality, and to its shadowy abstractness.
And further, it is objected that science, as a matter
of <i>content</i>, occupies itself with what is <i>necessary</i>. Now,
if Æsthetic puts aside the beauty of nature, we not
only gain nothing in respect of necessity, but to all
appearance have got further away from it. For the
expression <i>Nature</i> at once gives us the idea of Necessity
and Uniformity,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that is to say, of a behaviour
which may be hoped to be akin to science, and
capable of submitting thereto. But in the mind,
generally, and more particularly in the imagination,
compared with nature, caprice and lawlessness are
supposed to be peculiarly at home; and these withdraw
themselves as a matter of course from all scientific
explanation.</p>

<p>Thus in all these aspects&mdash;in origin, in effect, and
in range&mdash;fine art, instead of showing itself fitted for
scientific study, seems rather in its own right to resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the regulating activity of thought, and to be unsuitable
for strict scientific discussion.</p>

<p>These and similar objections against a genuinely
scientific treatment of fine art are drawn from common
ideas, points of view, and considerations, which
may be read <i>ad nauseam</i> in full elaboration in the
older writers upon beauty and the fine arts, especially
in the works of French authors. And in part they
contain facts which have a certain truth; in part, too,
the argumentation<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> based upon these facts appears
plausible at first sight. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, there is the fact
that the forms of beauty are as manifold as the phenomenon
of beauty is omnipresent; and from this, if
we choose, we may proceed to conclude to a universal
<i>impulse of Beauty</i> in human nature, and then go on
to the further inference: that because ideas of beauty
are so endlessly various, and therefore, as seems
obvious, are something <i>particular</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> it follows that
there can be no universal laws of beauty and of taste.</p>

<p>Before it is possible for us to turn from such
considerations to our subject proper, it is our business
to devote a brief introductory discussion to the
objections and doubts which have been raised. In
the first place, as regards the <i>worthiness</i> of art to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
scientifically considered, it is no doubt the case that
art can be employed as a fleeting pastime, to serve
the ends of pleasure and entertainment, to decorate
our surroundings, to impart pleasantness to the external
conditions of our life, and to emphasize other
objects by means of ornament. In this mode of
employment art is indeed not independent, not free,
but servile. But what <i>we</i> mean to consider, is the
art which is <i>free</i> in its end as in its means.</p>

<p>That art is in the abstract capable of serving other
aims, and of being a mere pastime, is moreover a
relation which it shares with thought. For, on the
one hand, science, in the shape of the subservient
understanding, submits to be used for finite purposes,
and as an accidental means, and in that case is not
self-determined, but determined by alien objects and
relations; but, on the other hand, science liberates
itself from this service to rise in free independence
to the attainment of truth, in which medium, free from
all interference, it fulfils itself in conformity with its
proper aims.</p>

<p>Fine art is not real art till it is in this sense free,
and only achieves its highest task when it has taken
its place in the same sphere with religion and philosophy,
and has become simply a mode of revealing to
consciousness and bringing to utterance the Divine
Nature,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the deepest interests of humanity, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
most comprehensive truths of the mind. It is in
works of art that nations have deposited the profoundest
intuitions and ideas of their hearts; and
fine art is frequently the key&mdash;with many nations
there is no other&mdash;to the understanding of their
wisdom and of their religion.</p>

<p>This is an attribute which art shares with religion
and philosophy, only in this peculiar mode, that it
represents even the highest ideas <i>in sensuous forms</i>,
thereby bringing them nearer to the character of
natural phenomena, to the senses, and to feeling.
The world, into whose depths <i>thought</i> penetrates, is a
supra-sensuous world, which is thus, to begin with,
erected as a <i>beyond</i> over against immediate consciousness
and present sensation; the power which
thus rescues itself from the <i>here</i>, that consists in the
actuality and finiteness of sense, is the freedom of
thought in cognition. But the mind is able to
heal this schism which its advance creates; it generates
out of itself the works of fine art as the first
middle term of reconciliation between pure thought
and what is external, sensuous, and transitory, between
nature with its finite actuality and the infinite
freedom of the reason that comprehends.</p>

<p>&delta;. The <i>element</i> of art was said to be in its general
nature an <i>unworthy</i> element, as consisting in appearance
and deception. The censure would be not
devoid of justice, if it were possible to class appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
as something that ought not to exist. An
appearance or show, however, is essential to existence.
Truth could not be, did it not appear and reveal
itself,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> were it not truth <i>for</i> some one or something,
<i>for</i> itself as also <i>for</i> Mind. Therefore there can be no
objection against appearance in general, but, if at all,
against the particular mode of appearance in which
art gives actuality to what is in itself real and true.
If, in this aspect, the <i>appearance</i> with which art gives
its conceptions life as determinate existences is to be
termed a <i>deception</i>, this is a criticism which primarily
receives its meaning by comparison with the external
world of phenomena and its immediate contact with
us as <i>matter</i>, and in like manner by the standard of
our own world of feeling, that is, the inner world of
<i>sense</i>. These are the two worlds to which, in the life
of daily experience, in our own phenomenal<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> life, we
are accustomed to attribute the value and the title
of actuality, reality, and truth, in contrast to art,
which we set down as lacking such reality and truth.
Now, this whole sphere of the empirical inner and
outer world is just what is not the world of genuine
reality, but is to be entitled a mere appearance more
strictly than is true of art, and a crueller deception.
Genuine reality is only to be found beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
immediacy of feeling and of external objects.
Nothing is genuinely real but that which is actual in
its own right,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that which is the substance of nature
and of mind, fixing itself indeed in present and
definite existence, but in this existence still retaining
its essential and self-centred being, and thus and no
otherwise attaining genuine reality. The dominion
of these universal powers is exactly what art accentuates
and reveals. The common outer and
inner world also no doubt present to us this essence
of reality, but in the shape of a chaos of accidental
matters, encumbered by the immediateness of sensuous
presentation, and by arbitrary states, events,
characters, etc. Art liberates the real import of
appearances from the semblance and deception of this
bad and fleeting world, and imparts to phenomenal
semblances a higher reality, born of mind. The
appearances of art, therefore, far from being mere
semblances, have the higher reality and the more
genuine existence in comparison with the realities of
common life.</p>

<p>Just as little can the representations of art be
called a deceptive semblance in comparison with the
representations of historical narrative, as if that had
the more genuine truth. For history has not even
immediate existence, but only the intellectual presentation
of it, for the element of its portrayals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
its content remains burdened with the whole mass of
contingent matter formed by common reality with its
occurrences, complications, and individualities. But
the work of art brings before us the eternal powers
that hold dominion in history, without any such superfluity
in the way of immediate sensuous presentation
and its unstable semblances.</p>

<p>Again, the mode of appearance of the shapes produced
by art may be called a deception in comparison
with philosophic thought, with religious or moral
principles. Beyond a doubt the mode of revelation
which a content attains in the realm of thought is the
truest reality; but in comparison with the show or
semblance of immediate sensuous existence or of
historical narrative, the artistic semblance has the
advantage that in itself it points beyond itself, and
refers us away from itself to something spiritual
which it is meant to bring before the mind's eye.
Whereas immediate appearance does not give itself
out to be deceptive, but rather to be real and true,
though all the time its truth is contaminated and
infected by the immediate sensuous element. The
hard rind of nature and the common world give the
mind more trouble in breaking through to the idea
than do the products of art.</p>

<p>But if, on the one side, we assign this high position
to art, we must no less bear in mind, on the other
hand, that art is not, either in content or in form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the supreme and absolute mode of bringing the
mind's genuine interests into consciousness. The
form of art is enough to limit it to a restricted content.
Only a certain circle and grade of truth is
capable of being represented in the medium of art.
Such truth must have in its own nature the capacity
to go forth into sensuous form and be adequate to
itself therein, if it is to be a genuinely artistic content,
as is the case with the gods of Greece. There is,
however, a deeper form of truth, in which it is no
longer so closely akin and so friendly to sense as
to be adequately embraced and expressed by that
medium. Of such a kind is the Christian conception
of truth; and more especially the spirit of our modern
world, or, to come closer, of our religion and our
intellectual culture, reveals itself as beyond the stage
at which art is the highest mode assumed by man's
consciousness of the absolute. The peculiar mode
to which artistic production and works of art belong
no longer satisfies our supreme need. We are above
the level at which works of art can be venerated
as divine, and actually worshipped; the impression
which they make is of a more considerate kind, and
the feelings which they stir within us require a
higher test and a further confirmation. Thought
and reflection have taken their flight above fine art.
Those who delight in grumbling and censure may
set down this phenomenon for a corruption, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
ascribe it to the predominance of passion and selfish
interests, which scare away at once the seriousness
and the cheerfulness of art. Or we may accuse the
troubles of the present time and the complicated
condition of civil and political life as hindering the
feelings, entangled in minute preoccupations, from
freeing themselves, and rising to the higher aims of
art, the intelligence itself being subordinate to petty
needs and interests, in sciences which only subserve
such purposes and are seduced into making this
barren region their home.</p>

<p>However all this may be, it certainly is the case,
that art no longer affords that satisfaction of spiritual
wants which earlier epochs and peoples have sought
therein, and have found therein only; a satisfaction
which, at all events on the religious side, was most
intimately and profoundly connected with art. The
beautiful days of Greek art, and the golden time
of the later middle ages are gone by. The reflective
culture of our life of to-day, makes it a necessity
for us, in respect of our will no less than of our
judgment, to adhere to general points of view, and
to regulate particular matters according to them, so
that general forms, laws, duties, rights, maxims are
what have validity as grounds of determination and
are the chief regulative force. But what is required
for artistic interest as for artistic production is,
speaking generally, a living creation, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
universal is not present as law and maxim, but acts
as if one with the mood and the feelings, just as,
in the imagination, the universal and rational is contained
only as brought into unity with a concrete
sensuous phenomenon. Therefore, our present in its
universal condition is not favourable to art. As
regards the artist himself, it is not merely that the
reflection which finds utterance all round him, and
the universal habit of having an opinion and passing
judgment about art infect him, and mislead him into
putting more abstract thought into his works themselves;
but also the whole spiritual culture of the
age is of such a kind that he himself stands within
this reflective world and its conditions, and it is
impossible for him to abstract from it by will and
resolve, or to contrive for himself and bring to pass,
by means of peculiar education or removal from the
relations of life, a peculiar solitude that would replace
all that is lost.</p>

<p>In all these respects art is, and remains for us,
on the side of its highest destiny, a thing of the past.
Herein it has further lost for us its genuine truth
and life, and rather is transferred into our <i>ideas</i>
than asserts its former necessity, or assumes its
former place, in reality. What is now aroused in
us by works of art is over and above our immediate
enjoyment, and together with it, our judgment;
inasmuch as we subject the content and the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of representation of the work of art and the suitability
or unsuitability of the two to our intellectual
consideration. Therefore, the <i>science</i> of art is a much
more pressing need in our day, than in times in
which art, simply as art, was enough to furnish a full
satisfaction. Art invites us to consideration of it
by means of thought, not to the end of stimulating
art production, but in order to ascertain scientifically
what art is.</p>

<p>&eta;. As soon as we propose to accept this invitation
we are met by the difficulty which has already been
touched upon in the suggestion that, though art is
a suitable subject for philosophical reflection in the
general sense, yet it is not so for systematic and
scientific discussion. In this objection there lies the
false idea that a philosophical consideration may,
nevertheless, be unscientific. On this point it can
only be remarked here with brevity, that, whatever
ideas others may have of philosophy and philosophizing,
I regard the pursuit of philosophy as utterly
incapable of existing apart from a scientific procedure.
Philosophy has to consider its object in its necessity,
not, indeed, in its subjective necessity or external
arrangement, classification, etc., but it has to unfold
and demonstrate the object out of the necessity of its
own inner nature. Until this evolution<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is brought
to pass the scientific element is lacking to the treatment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
In as far, however, as the objective necessity
of an object lies essentially in its logical and metaphysical
nature, the isolated treatment of art must
be conducted with a certain relaxation of scientific
stringency. For art involves the most complex pre-suppositions,
partly in reference to its content, partly
in respect of its medium<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and element,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in which art
is constantly on the borders of the arbitrary or accidental.
Thus it is only as regards the essential
innermost progress of its content and of its media of
expression that we must call to mind the outline
prescribed by its necessity.</p>

<p>The objection that works of fine art elude the
treatment of scientific thought because they originate
out of the unregulated fancy and out of the feelings,
are of a number and variety that defy the attempt to
gain a conspectus, and therefore take effect only on
feeling and imagination, raises a problem which
appears still to have importance. For the beauty of
art does in fact appear in a form which is expressly
contrasted with abstract thought, and which the latter
is forced to destroy in exerting the activity which is
its nature. This idea coheres with the opinion that
reality as such, the life of nature and of mind, is
disfigured and slain by comprehension; that, so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>from being brought close to us by the thought which
comprehends, it is by it that such life is absolutely
dissociated from us, so that, by the use of thought as
the <i>means</i> of grasping what has life, man rather cuts
himself off from this his purpose. We cannot speak
fully on this subject in the present passage, but only
indicate the point of view from which the removal of
this difficulty, or impossibility depending on maladaptation,
might be effected.</p>

<p>It will be admitted, to begin with, that the mind is
capable of contemplating itself, and of possessing a
consciousness, and that a <i>thinking</i> consciousness, of
itself and all that is generated by itself. Thought&mdash;to
think&mdash;is precisely that in which the mind has its
innermost and essential nature. In gaining this
thinking consciousness concerning itself and its products,
the mind is behaving according to its essential
nature, however much freedom and caprice those
products may display, supposing only that in real
truth they have mind in them. Now art and its
works as generated and created by the mind (spirit),
are themselves of a spiritual nature, even if their
mode of representation admits into itself the semblance
of sensuous being, and pervades what is
sensuous with mind. In this respect art is, to begin
with, nearer to mind and its thinking activity than is
mere external unintelligent nature; in works of art,
mind has to do but with its own. And even if artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
works are not abstract thought and notion, but are an
evolution of the notion <i>out of</i> itself, an alienation from
itself towards the sensuous, still the power of the
thinking spirit (mind) lies herein, <i>not merely</i> to grasp
<i>itself only</i> in its peculiar form of the self-conscious
spirit (mind), but just as much to recognize itself in
its alienation in the shape of feeling and the sensuous,
in its other form, by transmuting the metamorphosed
thought back into definite thoughts, and so restoring
it to itself. And in this preoccupation with the other
of itself the thinking spirit is not to be held untrue to
itself as if forgetting or surrendering itself therein,
nor is it so weak as to lack strength to comprehend
what is different from itself, but it comprehends both
itself and its opposite. For the notion is the universal,
which preserves itself in its particularizations,
dominates alike itself and its "other," and so becomes
the power and activity that consists in undoing the
alienation which it had evolved. And thus the work
of art in which thought alienates itself belongs, like
thought itself, to the realm of comprehending thought,
and the mind, in subjecting it to scientific consideration,
is thereby but satisfying the want of its own
inmost nature. For because thought is its essence
and notion, it can in the last resort only be satisfied
when it has succeeded in imbuing all the products of
its activity with thought, and has thus for the first
time made them genuinely its own. But, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
shall see more definitely below, art is far from being
the highest form of mind, and receives its true ratification
only from science.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Just as little does art elude philosophical consideration
by unbridled caprice. As has already been
indicated, it is its true task to bring to consciousness
the highest interests of the mind. Hence it follows
at once with respect to the <i>content</i> that fine art cannot
rove in the wildness of unfettered fancy, for these
spiritual interests determine definite bases<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for its
content, how manifold and inexhaustible soever its
forms and shapes may be. The same holds true for
the forms themselves. They, again, are not at the
mercy of mere chance. Not every plastic shape<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is
capable of being the expression and representation
of those spiritual interests, of absorbing and of reproducing
them; every definite content determines a
form suitable to it.</p>

<p>In this aspect too, then, we are in a position to
find our bearings according to the needs of thought
in the apparently unmanageable mass of works and
types of art.</p>

<p>Thus, I hope, we have begun by defining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
content of our science, to which we propose to
confine ourselves, and have seen that neither is fine
art unworthy of a philosophical consideration, nor is
a philosophical consideration incompetent to arrive
at a knowledge of the essence of fine art.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">METHODS OF SCIENCE APPLICABLE TO BEAUTY
AND ART.</p>


<p>If we now investigate <i>the required mode of scientific
consideration</i>, we here again meet with two opposite
ways of treating the subject, each of which appears
to exclude the other, and so to hinder us from
arriving at <i>any true result</i>.</p>

<p>On one side we see the science of art merely, so to
speak, busying itself about the actual productions of
art from the outside, arranging them in series as a
history of art, initiating discussions about extant
works, or sketching out theories intended to provide
the general points of view that are to govern both
criticism and artistic production.</p>

<p>On the other side we see science abandoning
itself independently to reflection upon the beautiful,
and producing mere generalities which do not touch
the work of art in its peculiarity, creating, in short,
an abstract philosophy of the beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>1. As regards the former mode of treatment, which
starts from the empirical side, it is the indispensable
road for any one who means to become a student of art.
And just as in the present day every one, even though
he is not busied with natural science, yet pretends to
be equipped with the essentials of physical knowledge,
so it has become more or less obligatory for
a cultivated man to possess some acquaintance with
art,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and the pretension to display one's-self as a
dilettante and connoisseur is pretty universal.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If such information is really to be recognized
as art-scholarship,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> it must be of various kinds and
of wide range. The first necessity is an exact
acquaintance with the immeasurable region of
individual works of art of ancient and modern times,
works which in part have actually perished, in part
belong to distant countries or portions of the world,
or which adverse fortune has withdrawn from one's
own observation. Moreover, every work belongs to
its <i>age</i>, to its <i>nation</i>, and to its environment, and
depends upon particular historical and other ideas
and aims. For this reason art-scholarship further
requires a vast wealth of historical information of a
very special kind, seeing that the individualized
nature of the work of art is related to individual
detail and demands special matter to aid in its comprehension
and elucidation. And lastly, this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of scholarship not only needs, like every other, a
memory for information, but a vivid imagination in
order to retain distinctly the images of artistic forms
in all their different features, and especially in order
to have them present to the mind for purposes of
comparison with other works.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Within this kind of consideration, which is
primarily historical, there soon emerge various points
of view which cannot be lost sight of in contemplating
a work of art, inasmuch as our judgments must be
derived from them. Now these points of view, as
in other sciences which have an empirical starting-point,
when extracted and put together form universal
criteria and rules, and, in a still further stage of formal
generalization, <i>Theories of the arts</i>. This is not the
place to go into detail about literature of this kind,
and it may, therefore, suffice to mention a few
writings in the most general way. For instance,
there is Aristotle's "Poetics," the theory of tragedy
contained in which is still of interest; and to speak
more particularly, among the ancients, Horace's "Ars
Poetica" and Longinus's "Treatise on the Sublime"
suffice to give a general idea of the way in which this
kind of theorizing has been carried on. The general
formulæ which were abstracted by such writers were
meant to stand especially as precepts and rules,
according to which, particularly in times of degeneration
of poetry and art, works of art were meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
be produced. The prescriptions, however, compiled
by these physicians of art had even less assured
success than those of physicians whose aim was the
restoration of health.</p>

<p>Respecting theories of this kind, I propose merely
to mention that, though <i>in detail</i> they contain much
that is instructive, yet their remarks were abstracted
from a very limited circle of artistic productions,
which passed for <i>the</i> genuinely beautiful ones, but
yet always belonged to a but narrow range of art.
And again, such formulæ are in part very trivial
reflections which in their generality proceed to no
establishment of particulars, although this is the
matter of chief concern.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Horatian epistle is full of
these reflections, and, therefore, is a book for all men,
but one which for this very reason contains much that
amounts to nothing, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci</div>
<div class="line">Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo"&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>"He carries all votes, who has mingled the pleasant
and the useful, by at once charming and instructing his
reader." This is just like so many copybook headings,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
<i>e.g.</i> "Stay at home and earn an honest livelihood,"
which are right enough as generalities, but lack the
concrete determinations on which action depends.</p>

<p>Another kind of interest was found, not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
express aim of directly causing the production of
genuine works of art, but in the purpose which
emerged of influencing men's judgment upon works
of art by such theories, in short of <i>forming taste</i>. In
this aspect, Home's "Elements of Criticism," the
writings of Batteux, and Ramler's "Introduction to
the Fine Arts," were works much read in their day.
Taste in this sense has to do with arrangement and
treatment, the harmony and finish of what belongs to
the external aspect of a work of art. Besides, they
brought in among the principles of taste views that
belonged to the psychology that was then in vogue,
and that had been drawn from empirical observation
of capacities and activities of the soul, of the passions
and their probable heightening, succession, etc. But
it remains invariably the case that every man judges
works of art, or characters, actions, and incidents
according to the measure of his insight and his feelings;
and as that formation of taste only touched
what was meagre and external, and moreover drew
its precepts only from a narrow range of works of art
and from a <i>borné</i> culture of intellect and feelings, its
whole sphere was inadequate, and incapable of seizing
the inmost and the true, and of sharpening the eye
for the apprehension thereof.</p>

<p>Such theories proceed in general outline, as do the
remaining non-philosophic sciences. The content
which they subject to consideration is borrowed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
our idea of it, as something found there; then further
questions are asked about the nature of this idea,
inasmuch as a need reveals itself for closer determinations,
which are also found in our idea of the matter,
and drawn from it to be fixed in definitions. But in
so doing, we find ourselves at once on uncertain and
debatable ground. It might indeed appear at first
as if the beautiful were a perfectly simple idea. But
it soon becomes evident that manifold sides may be
found in it, one of which is emphasized by one writer
and another by another, or, even if the same points of
view are adopted, a dispute arises on the question which
side after all is to be regarded as the essential one.</p>

<p>With a view to such questions it is held a point of
scientific completeness to adduce and to criticize the
various definitions of the beautiful. We will do this
neither with historical <i>exhaustiveness</i>, so as to learn
all the subtleties which have emerged in the defining
process, nor for the sake of the <i>historical</i> interest;
but we will simply produce by way of illustration,
some of the more interesting modern views which
come pretty close in their purport to what in fact the
idea of the beautiful does involve. For such purpose
we have chiefly to mention Goethe's account of the
beautiful, which Meyer embodied in his "History of
the Formative Arts<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in Greece," on which occasion he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
also brings forward Hirt's view, though without
mentioning him.</p>

<p>Hirt, one of the greatest of genuine connoisseurs
in the present day, in his brochure about artistic
beauty (<i>Horen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> 1797, seventh number), after speaking
of the beautiful in the several arts, sums up his
ideas in the result that the basis of a just criticism
of beauty in art and of the formation of taste is the
conception of the <i>Characteristic</i>. That is to say, he
defines the beautiful as the "perfect, which is or can
be an object of eye, ear, or imagination." Then he
goes on to define the perfect as "that which is
adequate to its aim, that which nature or art aimed
at producing within the given genus and species<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in
the formation of the object." For which reason, in
order to form our judgment on a question of beauty,
we ought to direct our observation as far as possible
to the individual marks which constitute a definite
essence. For it is just these marks that form its
characteristics. And so by <i>character</i> as the law of
art he means "that determinate individual modification<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
whereby forms, movement and gesture, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and expression, local colour, light and shade, chiaroscuro<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and attitude distinguish themselves, in conformity,
of course, with the requirements of an object
previously selected." This formula gives us at once
something more significant than the other definitions.
If we go on to ask what "the characteristic" is, we
see that it involves in the first place <i>a content</i>, as, for
instance, a particular feeling, situation, incident, action,
individual; and secondly, the <i>mode</i> and <i>fashion</i> in
which this content is embodied in a representation.
It is to this, the mode of representation, that the
artistic law of the "characteristic" refers, inasmuch
as it requires that every particular element in the
mode of expression shall subserve the definite indication
of its content and be a member in the expression
of that content. The abstract formula of the characteristic
thus has reference to the degree of appropriateness
with which the particular detail of the
artistic form sets in relief the content which it
is intended to represent. If we desire to illustrate
this conception in a quite popular way, we may
explain the limitation which it involves as follows.
In a dramatic work, for instance, an action forms
the content; the drama<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> is to represent how this
action takes place. Now, men and women do all
sorts of things; they speak to each other from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to time, at intervals they eat, sleep, put on their
clothes, say one thing and another, and so forth.
But in all this, whatever does not stand in immediate
connection with that particular action considered as
the content proper, is to be excluded, so that in
reference to it nothing may be without import. So,
too, a picture, that only represented a single phase of
that action, might yet include in it&mdash;so wide are the
ramifications of the external world&mdash;a multitude of
circumstances, persons, positions, and other matters
which at that moment have no reference to the
action in question, and are not subservient to its
distinctive character.</p>

<p>But, according to the rule of the characteristic,
only so much ought to enter into the work of art as
belongs to the display<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and, essentially, to the
expression of that content and no other; for nothing
must announce itself as otiose and superfluous.</p>

<p>This is a very important rule, which may be justified
in a certain aspect. Meyer, however, in his
above-mentioned work, gives it as his opinion that
this view has vanished and left no trace, and, in his
judgment, to the benefit of art. For he thinks that
the conception in question would probably have <i>led</i>
to caricature. This judgment at once contains the
perversity of implying that such a determination of
the beautiful had to do with <i>leading</i>. The Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of art does not trouble itself about precepts for artists,
but it has to ascertain what beauty in general is, and
how it has displayed itself in actual productions, in
works of art, without meaning to give rules for guidance.
Apart from this, if we examine the criticism,
we find it to be true, no doubt, that Hirt's definition
includes caricature, for even a caricature may be
characteristic; but, on the other hand, it must be
answered at once that in caricature the definite
character is intensified to exaggeration, and is, so to
speak, a superfluity of the characteristic. But a
superfluity ceases to be what is properly required in
order to be characteristic, and becomes an offensive
iteration, whereby the characteristic itself may be
made unnatural. Moreover, what is of the nature of
caricature shows itself in the light of the characteristic
representation of what is ugly, which ugliness
is, of course, a distortion. Ugliness, for its part, is
closely connected with the content, so that it may be
said that the principle of the characteristic involves as
a fundamental property both ugliness and the representation
of what is ugly. Hirt's definition, of course,
gives no more precise information as to what is to be
characterized and what is not, in the artistically beautiful,
or about the content of the beautiful, but it furnishes
in this respect a mere formal rule, which nevertheless
contains some truth, although stated in abstract shape.</p>

<p>Then follows the further question&mdash;what Meyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
opposes to Hirt's artistic principle, <i>i.e.</i> what he himself
prefers. He is treating, in the first place, exclusively
of the principle shown in the artistic works
of the ancients, which principle, however, must include
the essential attribute[A] of beauty. In dealing
with this subject he is led to speak of Mengs
and Winckelmann's principle<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of the Ideal, and
pronounces himself to the effect that he desires
neither to reject nor wholly to accept this law of
beauty, but, on the other hand, has no hesitation in
attaching himself to the opinion of an enlightened
judge of art (Goethe), as it is definite,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and seems to
solve the enigma more precisely.</p>

<p>Goethe says: "The highest principle of the
ancients was the <i>significant</i>, but the highest result of
successful <i>treatment</i>, the <i>beautiful</i>."</p>

<p>If we look closer at what this opinion implies, we
find in it again two elements; the content or matter
in hand, and the mode and fashion of representation.
In looking at a work of art we begin with what presents
itself immediately to us, and after that go on to
consider what is its significance or content.</p>

<p>The former, the external element, has no value for
us simply as it stands; we assume something further
behind it, something inward, a significance, by which
the external semblance has a soul breathed into it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
It is this, its soul, that the external appearance indicates.
For an appearance which means something,
does not present to the mind's eye itself and that
which it is <i>qua</i> external, but something else; as does
the <i>symbol</i> for instance, and still more obviously the
<i>fable</i>, whose moral and precept constitutes its meaning.
Indeed every <i>word</i> points to a meaning and has
no value in itself. Just so the human eye, a man's
face, flesh, skin, his whole figure, are a revelation of
mind and soul, and in this case the meaning is always
something other than what shows itself within the
immediate appearance. This is the way in which a
work of art should have its meaning, and not appear
as exhausted in these mere particular lines, curves,
surfaces, borings, reliefs in the stone, in these colours,
tones, sounds, of words, or whatever other medium is
employed; but it should reveal life, feeling, soul,
import and mind, which is just what we mean by the
significance of a work of art.</p>

<p>Thus this requirement of <i>significance</i> in a work of
art amounts to hardly anything beyond or different
from Hirt's principle of the <i>characteristic</i>.</p>

<p>According to this notion, then, we find distinguished
as the elements of the beautiful something
inward, a content, and something outer which has that
content as its significance; the inner shows itself in the
outer and gives itself to be known by its means, inasmuch
as the outer points away from itself to the inner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot go into detail on this head.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) But the earlier fashion alike of rules and of
theories has already been violently thrown aside in
Germany&mdash;especially owing to the appearance of
genuine living poetry,&mdash;and the rights of genius, its
works and their effects, have had their value asserted
against the encroachment of such legalities and against
the wide watery streams of theory. From this
foundation both of an art which is itself genuinely
spiritual, and of a general sympathy and communion
with it, have arisen the receptivity and freedom which
enabled us to enjoy and to recognize the great works
of art which have long been in existence, whether
those of the modern world,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the middle ages, or
even of peoples of antiquity quite alien to us (<i>e.g.</i> the
Indian productions); works which by reason of their
antiquity or of their alien nationality have, no doubt,
a foreign element in them, yet in view of their
content&mdash;common to all humanity and dominating
their foreign character&mdash;could not have been branded
as products of bad and barbarous taste, except by
the prejudices of theory. This recognition, to speak
generally, of works of art which depart from the
sphere and form of those upon which more especially
the abstractions of theory were based, led, in the
first instance, to the recognition of a peculiar kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of art&mdash;that is, of <i>romantic</i> art,&mdash;and it therefore
became necessary to apprehend the idea and the
nature of the beautiful in a deeper way than was
possible for those theories. With this influence there
co-operated another, viz. that the idea in its self-conscious
form, the thinking mind, attained at this time,
on its side, a deeper self-knowledge in philosophy,
and was thereby directly impelled to understand the
essence of art, too, in a profounder fashion.</p>

<p>Thus, then, even judging by the phases of this
more general evolution of ideas, the theoretical mode
of reflection upon art which we were considering
has become antiquated alike in its principles and
in its particulars. Only the <i>scholarship</i> of the history
of art has retained its permanent value, and
cannot but retain it, all the more that the advance
of intellectual receptivity, of which we spoke, has
extended its range of vision on every side. Its
business and vocation consists in the æsthetic appreciation
of individual works of art, and in acquaintance
with the historical circumstances that externally
condition such works; an appreciation which, if
made with sense and mind, supported by the
requisite historical information, is the only power
that can penetrate the entire individuality of a work
of art. Thus Goethe, for instance, wrote much about
art and particular works of art. Theorizing proper
is not the purpose of this mode of consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
although no doubt it frequently busies itself with
abstract principles and categories, and may give way
to this tendency without being aware of it. But for
a reader who does not let this hinder him, but keeps
before him the concrete accounts of works of art,
which we spoke of just now, it at all events furnishes
the philosophy of art with the perceptible illustrations
and instances, into the particular historical details of
which philosophy cannot enter.</p>

<p>This, then, may be taken to be the first mode of
the study of art, starting from particular and extant
works.</p>

<p>2. There is an essential distinction between this
and the opposite aspect, the wholly theoretical reflection,
which made an effort to understand beauty as
such out of itself alone, and to get to the bottom of
its idea.</p>

<p>It is well known that Plato was the first to require
of philosophical study, in a really profound sense, that
its objects should be apprehended, not in their <i>particularity</i>,
but in their <i>universality</i>, in their genius,
in their own nature and its realization: inasmuch as
he affirmed that the truth of things<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> did not consist
in individual good actions, true opinions, beautiful
human beings or works of art, but in <i>goodness</i>, <i>beauty</i>,
<i>truth</i> themselves. Now, if the beautiful is in fact
to be known according to its essence and conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
this is only possible by help of the thinking idea, by
means of which the logico-metaphysical nature of the
<i>Idea as such</i>, as also that of the <i>particular Idea of the
beautiful</i> enters into the thinking consciousness. But
the study of the beautiful in its separate nature and
in its own idea may itself turn into an abstract Metaphysic,
and even though Plato is accepted in such an
inquiry as foundation and as guide, still the Platonic
abstraction must not satisfy us, even for the logical
idea of beauty. We must understand this idea more
profoundly and more in the concrete, for the emptiness
of content which characterizes the Platonic idea is
no longer satisfactory to the fuller philosophical
wants of the mind of to-day. Thus it is, no doubt,
the case that we, too, in modern times, must in our
philosophy of art start from the idea of the beautiful,
but we ought not to abide by the fashion of Platonic
ideas, which was purely abstract, and was the mere
beginning of the philosophic study of beauty.</p>

<p>3. The philosophic conception of the beautiful, to
indicate its true nature at least by anticipation, must
contain, reconciled within it, the two extremes which
have been mentioned, by combining metaphysical
universality with the determinateness of real particularity.
Only thus is it apprehended in its truth, in its
real and explicit nature. It is then fertile out of its
own resources, in contrast to the barrenness of one-sided
reflection. For it has in accordance with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
own conception to develop into a totality of attributes,
while the conception itself as well as its detailed
exposition contains the necessity of its particulars, as
also of their progress and transition one into another.
On the other hand, again, these particulars, to which
the transition is made, carry in themselves the universality
and essentiality of the conception as the particulars
of which they appear. The modes of
consideration of which we have so far been treating,
lack both these qualities,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and for this reason it is
only the complete conception of which we have just
spoken that can lead to substantive, necessary, and
self-complete determinations.</p>

<p class="center">THE CONCEPTION OF ARTISTIC BEAUTY.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part I.&mdash;The Work Of Art as Made and as Sensuous.</span></p>

<p>After the above prefatory remarks, we approach
closer to our subject, the philosophy of artistic beauty.
Inasmuch as we are undertaking to treat it scientifically
we must begin with its <i>Conception</i>. Not
till we have established this conception can we map
out the division, and with it the plan of the entirety
of the science; for a division, if it is not, as is the case
with unphilosophical inquiries, taken in hand in a
purely external manner, must find its principle in the
conception of the object itself.</p>

<p>In presence of such a demand we are at once met
by the question, "Whence do we get this conception?"
If we begin with the given conception of artistic
beauty itself, that is enough to make it a <i>pre-supposition</i>
and mere assumption; now, mere assumptions
are not admitted by the philosophical method, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whatever it allows to pass must have its truth demonstrated,
<i>i.e.</i> displayed as necessary.</p>

<p>We will devote a few words to coming to an
understanding upon this difficulty, which concerns the
introduction to every philosophical branch of study
when taken in hand by itself.</p>

<p>The object of every science presents <i>prima facie</i>
two aspects: in the first place, that such an object <i>is</i>;
in the second place, <i>what</i> it is.</p>

<p>In ordinary science little difficulty attaches to the
first of these points. It might even, at first sight, look
ridiculous, if the requirement were presented that in
astronomy and physics it should be demonstrated
that there was a sun, heavenly bodies, magnetic phenomena,
etc. In these sciences, which have to do
with what is given to sense, the objects are taken
from external experience, and instead of demonstrating
them ("beweisen") it is thought sufficient to show
them ("weisen"). Yet even within the non-philosophical
sciences, doubts may arise about the existence of
their objects, as <i>e.g.</i> in psychology, the science of mind,
it may be doubted if there <i>is</i> a soul, a mind, <i>i.e.</i> something
subjective, separate, and independent, distinct
from what is material; or in theology, whether a God
<i>is</i>. If, moreover, the objects are of subjective kind,
<i>i.e.</i> are given only in the mind, and not as external
sensuous objects, we are confronted by our conviction
that there is nothing in the mind but what its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
activity has produced. This brings up the accidental
question whether men have produced this inner idea
or perception in their minds or not, and even if the
former is actually the case, whether they have not
made the idea in question vanish again, or at any
rate degraded it to a merely <i>subjective idea</i>, whose
content has no natural and independent being. So,
for instance, the beautiful has often been regarded as
not naturally and independently necessary in our
ideas, but as a mere subjective pleasure or accidental
sense. Our external intuitions, observations, and
perceptions are often deceptive and erroneous, but
still more is this the case with the inner ideas, even if
they have in themselves the greatest vividness, and
are forcible enough to transport us irresistibly into
passion.</p>

<p>This doubt whether an object of inward ideas and
inward perception as such is or is not, as also the
accidental question whether the subjective consciousness
has produced it in itself, and whether the act or
mode in which it brought it before itself was in its
turn adequate to the object in its essential and independent
nature&mdash;all this is just what aroused in men
the higher scientific need, which demands that, even
if we have an idea that an object is, or that there is
such an object, the object must yet be displayed or
demonstrated in terms of its necessity.</p>

<p>This proof, if it is developed in a really scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
way, must also satisfy the further question <i>What</i> an
object is. But to expound this relation would carry
us too far in this place, and we can only make the
following remarks on the point.</p>

<p>If we are to display the necessity of our object,
the beautiful in art, we should have to prove that art
or beauty was a result of antecedents such as, when
considered in their true conception, to lead us on with
scientific necessity to the idea of fine art. But in as
far as we begin with <i>art</i>, and propose to treat of the
essence of <i>its</i> idea and of the realization of that idea,
not of antecedents which go before it <i>as demanded by</i>
its idea, so far art, as a peculiar scientific object, has,
for us, a pre-supposition which lies beyond our consideration,
and which, being a different content, belongs
in scientific treatment to a different branch of
philosophical study. For it is nothing short of the
whole of philosophy that is the knowledge of the
universe as in itself <i>one single</i> organic totality which
develops itself out of its own conception, and which,
returning into itself so as to form a whole in virtue of
the necessity in which it is placed towards itself,
binds itself together with itself into <i>one single</i> world
of truth. In the coronal of this scientific necessity,
each individual part is just as much a circle that
returns into itself, as it has, at the same time, a
necessary connection with other parts. This connection
is a backward out of which it derives itself, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
as a forward, to which in its own nature it impels itself
on and on, in as far as it is fertile by creating fresh
matter out of itself, and issuing it into the further
range of scientific knowledge. Therefore, it is not
our present aim to demonstrate the idea of beauty
from which we set out, that is, to derive it according
to its necessity from the pre-suppositions which are
its antecedents in science. This task belongs to an
encyclopædic development of philosophy as a whole
and of its particular branches. For us, the idea of
beauty and of art is a pre-supposition given in the
system of philosophy. But as we cannot in this place
discuss this system, and the connection of art with it,
we have not yet the idea of the beautiful before us <i>in
a scientific form</i>; what we have at command are
merely the elements and aspects of it, as they are
or have at former periods been presented, in the
diverse ideas of the beautiful and of art in the mere
common consciousness. Having started from this
point, we shall subsequently pass to the more profound
consideration of the views in question, in order
thereby to gain the advantage of, in the first place,
obtaining a general idea of our object, and further, by
a brief criticism effecting a preliminary acquaintance
with its higher principles, with which we shall have to
do in the sequel. By this mode of treatment our
final introduction will act, so to speak, as the overture
to the account of the subject itself, and will serve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
purpose of a general collection and direction of our
thoughts towards the proper object-matter of our
discussion.</p>

<p>What we know, to begin with, as a current idea
of the work of art, comes under the three following
general predicates:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) We suppose the work of art to be no natural
product, but brought to pass by means of human
activity.</p>

<p>(2) To be essentially made <i>for</i> man, and, indeed,
to be more or less borrowed from the sensuous and
addressed to man's sense.</p>

<p>(3) To contain an <i>end</i>.</p>

<p>1. As regards the first point, that a work of art
is taken to be a product of human activity, this view
has given rise (<i>a</i>) to the view that this activity, being
the <i>conscious</i> production of an external object, can
also be <i>known</i>, and <i>expounded</i> and learnt, and prosecuted
by others. For, what one can do, it might
seem, another can do,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> or imitate,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as soon as he
is acquainted with the mode of procedure; so that,
supposing universal familiarity with the rules of
artistic production, it would only be a matter of any
one's will and pleasure to carry out the process in
a uniform way, and so to produce works of art. It
is thus that the above-mentioned rule-providing
theories and their precepts, calculated for practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
observance, have arisen. But that which can be
executed according to such instruction, can only be
something formally regular and mechanical. For
only what is mechanical is of such an external kind
that no more than a purely empty exercise of will
and dexterity is required to receive it among our
ideas and put it in act; such an exercise not needing
to be supplemented by anything concrete, or anything
that goes beyond the precepts conveyed in
general rules. This is most vividly displayed when
precepts of the kind in question do not limit themselves
to what is purely external and mechanical,
but extend to the meaning-laden spiritual activity
of true art. In this region the rules contain nothing
but indefinite generalities; <i>e.g.</i> "The theme ought to
be interesting, and each individual ought to be made
to speak according to his rank, age, sex, and position."
But if rules are meant to be adequate on this subject,
their precepts ought to have been drawn up with
such determinateness that they could be carried out
just as they are expressed, without further and
original activity of mind. Being abstract, however,
in their content, such rules reveal themselves, in
respect of their pretension of being adequate to fill
the consciousness of the artist, as wholly inadequate,
inasmuch as artistic production is not formal activity
in accordance with given determinations. For it is
bound as spiritual activity to work by drawing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
its own resources, and to bring before the mind's eye
a quite other and richer content and ampler individual
creations than any abstract formulæ can dictate.
Such rules may furnish guidance in case of need, if
they contain anything really definite, and therefore
of practical utility; but their directions can only
apply to purely external circumstances.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The tendency which we have just indicated
has therefore been abandoned, and, in place of it, the
opposite principle has been pursued to no less lengths.
For the work of art came to be regarded no longer
as the product of an <i>activity general</i> in mankind, but
as the work of a mind endowed with wholly peculiar
gifts. This mind, it is thought, has then nothing to
do but <i>simply</i> to give free play to its particular gift,
as though it were a specific force of nature, and is
to be entirely released from attention to laws of
universal validity, as also from the interference of
reflection in its instinctively creative operation. And,
indeed, it is to be guarded therefrom, inasmuch as
its productions could only be infected and tainted
by such a consciousness. In this aspect the work
of art was pronounced to be the product of <i>talent</i>
and <i>genius</i>, and stress was laid on the natural element
which talent and genius contain. The view was
partly right. Talent is specific, and genius universal
capability, with which a man has not the power to
endow himself simply by his own self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
activity. We shall treat this point more fully in
the sequel.</p>

<p>In this place we have only to mention the aspect
of falsity in the view before us, in that all consciousness
respecting the man's own activity was held, in
the case of artistic production, not merely superfluous,
but even injurious. Production on the part of talent
and genius then appears, in general terms, as a <i>state</i>,
and, in particular, as a state of <i>inspiration</i>. To such
a state, it is said, genius is in part excited by a given
object, and in part it has the power of its own free
will to place itself therein, in which process, moreover,
the good service of the champagne bottle is not
forgotten. This notion became prominent in Germany
in the so-called <i>epoch of genius</i>, which was introduced
by the early poetical productions of Goethe, and subsequently
sustained by those of Schiller.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In their
earliest works these poets began everything anew,
in scorn of all the rules which had then been fabricated,
transgressed these rules of set purpose, and,
while doing so, distanced all rivals by a long interval.
I will not enter more closely into the confusions
which have prevailed respecting the conception of
inspiration and genius, and which prevail even at the
present day respecting the omnipotence of inspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
as such. We need only lay down as essential the
view that, though the artist's talent and genius contains
a natural element, yet it is essentially in need
of cultivation by thought, and of reflection on the
mode in which it produces, as well as of practice and
skill in producing. A main feature of such production
is unquestionably external workmanship, inasmuch
as the work of art has a purely technical side,
which extends into the region of handicraft; most
especially in architecture and sculpture, less so in
painting and music, least of all in poetry. Skill in
this comes not by inspiration, but solely by reflection,
industry, and practice; and such skill is indispensable
to the artist, in order that he may master his external
material, and not be thwarted by its stubbornness.</p>

<p>Moreover, the higher an artist ranks, the more
profoundly ought he to represent the depths of heart
and mind; and these are not known without learning
them, but are only to be fathomed by the direction
of a man's own mind to the inner and outer world.
So here, too, <i>study</i> is the means whereby the artist
brings this content into his consciousness, and wins
the matter and burden of his conceptions.</p>

<p>In this respect one art may need the consciousness
and cognition of such matter more than others.
Music, for instance, which concerns itself only with
the undefined movement of the inward spiritual nature,
and deals with musical sounds as, so to speak, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
without thought, needs little or no spiritual content
to be present in consciousness. It is for this reason
that musical talent generally announces itself in very
early youth, while the head is still empty and the
heart has been but little moved, and is capable of
attaining to a very considerable height in early years,
before mind and life have experience of themselves.
And again, as a matter of fact we often enough see
very great expertness in musical composition, as also
in execution, subsist along with remarkable barrenness
of mind and character. The reverse is the case with
poetry. In poetry all depends on the representation,&mdash;which
must be full of matter and thought&mdash;of man,
of his profounder interests, and of the powers that move
him; and therefore mind and heart themselves must
be richly and profoundly educated by life, experience,
and reflection, before genius can bring to pass anything
mature, substantial, and self-complete. Goethe's
and Schiller's first productions are of an immaturity,
and even of a rudeness and barbarism, that are absolutely
terrifying. This phenomenon, that the greater
part of those attempts display a predominant mass of
thoroughly prosaic and in part of frigid and commonplace
elements, furnishes the chief objection to the
common opinion, that inspiration is inseparable from
youth and youthful fire. Those two men of genius,
it may be said, were the first to give our nation works
of true poetry, and yet it was only their mature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
manhood<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that presented us with creations profound,
substantial, and the outcome of genuine inspiration,
while no less thoroughly perfect in form. Thus, too,
it was not till his old age that Homer devised and
uttered his immortal songs.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A third view, which concerns the idea of the
work of art as a product of human activity, refers to
the position of such a work towards the external
appearances of nature. It was an obvious opinion
for the common consciousness to adopt on this head,
that the work of art made by man ranked <i>below</i> the
product of nature. The work of art has no feeling
in itself, and is not through and through a living
thing, but, regarded as an external object, is dead.
But we are wont to prize the living more than the
dead. We must admit, of course, that the work of
art has not in itself movement and life. An animated
being in nature is within and without an organization
appropriately elaborated down to all its minutest
parts, while the work of art attains the semblance of
animation on its surface only, but within is common
stone, or wood and canvas, or, as in the case of poetry,
is idea, uttering itself in speech and letters. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
aspect, viz. its external existence, is not what makes
a work into a production of fine art; it is a work of
art only in as far as, being the offspring of mind, it
continues to belong to the realm of mind, has received
the baptism of the spiritual, and only represents that
which has been moulded in harmony with mind. A
human interest, the spiritual value which attaches to
an incident, to an individual character, to an action in
its plot and in its <i>dénoûment</i>, is apprehended in the
work of art, and exhibited more purely<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and transparently
than is possible on the soil of common
unartistic reality. This gives the work of art a higher
rank than anything produced by nature, which has
not sustained this passage through the mind. So, for
instance, by reason of the feeling and insight of which
a landscape as depicted by an artist is a manifestation,
such a work of mind assumes a higher rank than
the mere natural landscape. For everything spiritual
is better than anything natural. At any rate, no
existence in nature is able, like art, to represent
divine ideals.</p>

<p>Upon that which, in works of art, the mind borrows
from its own inner life it is able, even on the side of
external existence, to confer <i>permanence</i>; whereas the
individual living thing of nature is transient, vanishing,
and mutable in its aspect, while the work of art
persists. Though, indeed, it is not mere permanence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
but the accentuation of the character which animation
by mind confers, that constitutes its genuine pre-eminence
as compared with natural reality.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this higher rank assigned to the work
of art is in turn disputed by another idea of the
common consciousness. It is said that nature and its
products are a work of God, created by his goodness
and wisdom, whereas the work of art is <i>merely</i> a
human production, made after man's devising by
man's hands. In this antithesis between natural production
as a divine creation and human activity as a
merely finite creation, we at once come upon the misconception,
that God does <i>not</i> work in man and
through man, but limits the range of his activity to
nature alone. This false opinion is to be entirely
abandoned if we mean to penetrate the true conception
of art. Indeed, in opposition to such an idea, we
must adhere to the very reverse, believing that God
is more honoured by what mind does or makes than
by the productions or formations of nature. For not
only is there a divinity in man, but in him it is operative
under a form that is appropriate to the essence
of God, in a mode quite other and higher than in
nature. God is a Spirit, and it is only in man that
the medium through which the divine element passes
has the form of conscious spirit, that actively realizes
itself. In nature the corresponding medium is the
unconscious, sensible, and external, which is far below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
consciousness in value. In the products of art God
is operative neither more nor less than in the phenomena
of nature; but the divine element, as it makes
itself known in the work of art, has attained, as being
generated out of the mind, an adequate thoroughfare
for its existence; while existence in the unconscious
sensuousness of nature is not a mode of appearance
adequate to the Divine Being.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Granting, then, that the work of art is made
by man as a creation of mind, we come to the last
question, which will enable us to draw a deeper result
from what has been said. What is man's need to
produce works of art? On the one hand the production
may be regarded as a mere toy of chance and
of man's fancies, that might just as well be let alone
as pursued. For, it may be said, there are other and
better means for effecting that which is the aim of art,
and man bears in him interests that are yet higher
and of more import than art has power to satisfy.
But, on the other hand, art appears to arise from the
higher impulse and to satisfy the higher needs, at
times, indeed, even the highest, the absolute need of
man, being wedded to the religious interests of whole
epochs and peoples, and to their most universal intuitions
respecting the world. This inquiry concerning
the not contingent but absolute need of art we cannot
as yet answer completely, seeing that it is more concrete
than any shape which could here be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the answer.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> We must, therefore, content ourselves
for the present with merely establishing the following
points.</p>

<p>The universal and absolute need out of which art,
on its formal side,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> arises has its source in the fact that
man is a <i>thinking</i> consciousness, <i>i.e.</i> that he draws out
of himself, and makes explicit <i>for himself</i>, that which
he is, and, generally, whatever is. The things of
nature are only <i>immediate and single</i>, but man as mind
<i>reduplicates</i> himself, inasmuch as <i>prima facie</i> he <i>is</i>
like the things of nature, but in the second place just
as really is <i>for</i> himself, perceives himself, has ideas of
himself, thinks himself, and only thus is active self-realizedness.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
This consciousness of himself man
obtains in a twofold way: <i>in the first place theoretically</i>,
in as far as he has inwardly to bring himself into his
own consciousness, with all that moves in the human
breast, all that stirs and works therein, and, generally,
to observe and form an idea of himself, to fix
before himself what thought ascertains to be his real
being, and, in what is summoned out of his inner self
as in what is received from without, to recognize only
himself. Secondly, man is realized for himself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<i>practical</i> activity, inasmuch as he has the impulse, in
the medium which is directly given to him, and
externally presented before him, to produce himself,
and therein at the same time to recognize himself.
This purpose he achieves by the modification of
external things upon which he impresses the seal of
his inner being, and then finds repeated in them his
own characteristics. Man does this in order as a free
subject to strip the outer world of its stubborn
foreignness, and to enjoy in the shape and fashion of
things a mere external reality of himself.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Even the
child's first impulse involves this practical modification
of external things. A boy throws stones into
the river, and then stands admiring the circles that
trace themselves on the water, as an effect in which
he attains the sight of something that is his own doing.
This need traverses the most manifold phenomena, up
to the mode of self-production in the medium of
external things as it is known to us in the work of
art. And it is not only external things that man
treats in this way, but himself no less, <i>i.e.</i> his own
natural form, which he does not leave as he finds it,
but alters of set purpose. This is the cause of all
ornament and decoration, though it may be as barbarous,
as tasteless, as utterly disfiguring or even
destructive as crushing Chinese ladies' feet, or as
slitting the ears and lips. It is only among cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
men that change of the figure,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of behaviour, and
of every kind and mode of self-utterance emanates
from spiritual education.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The universal need for expression in art<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> lies,
therefore, in man's rational impulse to exalt the inner
and outer world into a spiritual consciousness for himself,
as an object in which he recognizes his own self.
He satisfies the need of this spiritual freedom when
he makes all that exists explicit for himself <i>within</i>,
and in a corresponding way realizes this his explicit
self <i>without</i>, evoking thereby, in this reduplication of
himself, what is in him into vision and into knowledge
for his own mind and for that of others. This is
the free rationality of man, in which, as all action and
knowledge, so also art has its ground and necessary
origin. The specific need of art, however, in contradistinction
to other action, political or moral, to
religious imagination and to scientific cognition, we
shall consider later.</p>

<p>2. We have so far been considering that aspect of
the work of art in which it is made by man. We
have now to pass on to its second characteristic, that
it is made for man's <i>sense</i>, and for this reason is more
or less borrowed from the sensuous.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) This reflection has furnished occasion for the
consideration to be advanced that fine art is intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to arouse feeling, and indeed more particularly the
feeling which we find suits us&mdash;that, is pleasant feeling.
Looking at the question thus, men have treated
the investigation of fine art as an investigation of the
feelings, and asked what feelings it must be held that
art ought to evoke,&mdash;fear, for example, and compassion;
and then, how these could be pleasant&mdash;how,
for example, the contemplation of misfortune could
produce satisfaction. This tendency of reflection is
traceable particularly to Moses Mendelssohn's times,
and many such discussions are to be found in his
writings. Yet such an investigation did not lead
men far, for feeling is the indefinite dull region of
the mind; what is felt remains wrapped in the form
of the most abstract individual subjectivity,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and
therefore the distinctions of feeling are also quite
abstract, and are not distinctions of the actual object-matter
itself. For instance, fear, anxiety, alarm,
terror, are no doubt of one and the same sort of
feeling variously modified, but in part are mere
quantitative heightenings, in part are forms which
in themselves have nothing to do with their content
itself, but are indifferent to it. In the case of fear,
for instance, an existence is given in which the
subject (<i>i.e.</i> a person) has an interest, but at the same
time sees approaching the negative that threatens to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
annihilate this existence, and so finds immediately in
himself, as a contradictory affection of his subjectivity,
the two at once, this interest and that negative. Now,
such fear considered in itself is not enough to condition
any content, but is capable of receiving into itself
the most diverse and opposite matters.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Feeling, as
such, is a thoroughly empty form of subjective
affection. No doubt this form may in some cases
be manifold in itself, as is hope, grief, joy, or pleasure;
and, again, may in such diversity comprehend
varied contents, as there is a feeling of justice, moral
feeling, sublime religious feeling, and so forth. But
the fact that such content is forthcoming in different
forms of feeling is not enough to bring to light its
essential and definite nature; they remain purely
subjective affections of myself, in which the concrete
matter vanishes, as though narrowed into a circle of
the utmost abstraction.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Therefore, the inquiry into
the feelings which art arouses, or ought to arouse,
comes utterly to a standstill in the indefinite, and is
a mode of study which precisely abstracts from the
content proper and from its concrete essence and
notion. For reflection upon feeling contents itself
with the observation of the subjective affection in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
its isolation, instead of diving into and fathoming the
matter in question itself, the work of art, and, while
engaged with it, simply letting go the mere subjectivity
and its states. In feeling it is just this
vacant subjectivity that is&mdash;not merely retained, but&mdash;given
the first place, and that is why men are so
fond of having emotions. And for the same reason
such a study becomes tedious from its indefiniteness
and vacancy, and repulsive from its attentiveness to
little subjective peculiarities.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Now, as a work of art is not merely to do in
general something of the nature of arousing emotion&mdash;for
this is a purpose which it would have in common,
without specific difference, with eloquence, historical
composition, religious edification, and so forth&mdash;but
is to do so only in as far as it is beautiful, reflection
hit upon the idea, seeing that beauty was the object,
of searching out a <i>peculiar feeling of beauty</i> to
correspond to it, and of discovering a particular <i>sense
of beauty</i>. In this search it soon appeared that such
a sense is no blind instinct made rigidly definite by
nature, and capable from the beginning in its own
independent essence of discerning beauty. Hence
it followed that education came to be demanded for
this sense, and the educated sense of beauty came to
be called <i>taste</i>, which, although an educated appreciation
and apprehension of the beautiful, was yet
supposed to retain the nature of immediate feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
We have already mentioned how abstract theories
undertook to educate such a sense of taste, and how
external and one-sided that sense remained. The
criticism of the time when those views prevailed, was
not only defective in <i>universal</i> principles, but also, in
its particular references to individual works of art,
was less directed to justifying a <i>definite</i> judgment&mdash;the
power to make one not having at that time been
acquired&mdash;than to advancing the general education
of taste. For this reason such education in its turn
came to a standstill in the indefinite, and merely
endeavoured so to equip feeling as sense of beauty
by help of reflection, that there might thenceforth be
capacity to find out beauty whenever and wherever
it should exist. Yet the depths of the matter
remained a sealed book to mere taste, for these
depths demand not only sensibility and abstract
reflection, but the undivided reason and the mind
in its solid vigour; while taste was only directed to
the external surface about which the feelings play,
and on which one-sided maxims may pass for valid.
But, for this very reason, what is called good taste
takes fright at all more profound effects of art, and is
silent where the reality comes in question, and where
externalities and trivialities vanish. For when great
passions and the movements of a profound soul are
unveiled, we are no longer concerned with the finer
distinctions of taste and its pettifogging particularities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
It feels that genius strides contemptuously over such
ground as this, and, shrinking before its power,
becomes uneasy, and knows not which way to turn.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) And thus, as we should expect, men have
abandoned the tendency to consider works of art
solely with an eye to the education of taste, and with
the purpose of merely displaying taste. The <i>connoisseur</i>,
or scholar of art, has replaced the art-judge,
or man of taste. The positive side of art-scholarship,
so far as it concerns a thorough acquaintance with
the entire circumference<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of the individual character
in a given work of art, we have already pronounced
to be essential to the study of art. For a work of
art, owing to its nature as at once material and
individual, is essentially originated by particular conditions
of the most various kinds, to which belong
especially the time and place of its production, then
the peculiar individuality of the artist, and in particular
the grade of technical development attained
by his art. Attention to all these aspects is indispensable
to distinct and thorough insight and cognition,
and even to the enjoyment of a work of art;
it is with them that connoisseurship, or art-scholarship,
is chiefly occupied; and all that it can do for
us in its own way is to be accepted with gratitude.
Yet, though such scholarship is entitled to rank as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
something essential, still it ought not to be taken
for the sole or supreme element in the relation which
the mind adopts towards a work of art, and towards
art in general. For art-scholarship (and this is its
defective side) is capable of resting in an acquaintance
with purely external aspects, such as technical or
historical details, etc., and of guessing but little, or
even knowing absolutely nothing, of the true and
real nature of a work of art. It may even form a
disparaging estimate of the value of more profound
considerations in comparison with purely positive,
technical, and historical information. Still, even so,
art-scholarship, if only it is of a genuine kind, at
least strives after definite grounds and information,
and an intelligent judgment, with which is closely
conjoined the more precise distinction of the different,
even if partly external, aspects in a work of art, and
the estimation of their importance.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) After these remarks upon the modes of study
which have arisen out of that aspect of a work of
art in which, being a sensuous object, it is invested
with a relation to man as a sensuous being, we will
now consider this aspect in its more essential relation
to art as such, and so (&alpha;) partly as regards the
work of art as object, (&beta;) partly with respect to the
subjectivity of the artist, his genius, talent, and so
on; but without entering into matter relative to
these points that can only proceed from the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of art in its universal idea. For we are not
yet on genuinely scientific ground, but have only
reached the province of external reflection.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) The work of art then, of course, presents itself
to sensuous apprehension. It is addressed to sensuous
feeling, outer or inner, to sensuous perception and
imagination, just as is the nature that surrounds us
without, or our own sensitive nature within. Even
a speech, for instance, may be addressed to sensuous
imagination and feeling. Notwithstanding, the work
of art is not only for the <i>sensuous</i> apprehension as
sensuous object, but its position is of such a kind
that as sensuous it is at the same time essentially
addressed to the <i>mind</i>, that the mind is meant to
be affected by it, and to find some sort of satisfaction
in it.</p>

<p>This intention of the work of art explains how
it is in no way meant to be a natural product and
to possess natural life, whether a natural product
is to be ranked higher or lower than a <i>mere</i> work
of art, as it is often called in a depreciatory sense.</p>

<p>For the sensuous aspect of the work of art has
a right to existence only in as far as it exists for
man's mind, but not in as far as <i>qua</i> sensuous thing
it has separate existence by itself.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> If we examine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>more closely in what way the sensuous is presented
to man, we find that what is sensuous may bear
various relations to the mind.</p>

<p>(<i>aa</i>) The lowest mode of apprehension, and that
least appropriate to the mind, is purely sensuous
apprehension. It consists naturally in mere looking,
listening, feeling, just as in seasons of mental fatigue
it may often be entertaining to go about without
thought, and just to hear and look around us. The
mind, however, does not rest in the mere apprehension
of external things by sight and hearing, it makes
them objects for its own inner nature, which then
is itself impelled in a correspondingly sensuous form
to realize itself in the things, and relates itself to
them as <i>desire</i>. In this appetitive relation to the
outer world, the man stands as a sensuous particular
over against the things as likewise particulars; he
does not open his mind to them with general ideas
as a thinking being, but has relations dictated by
particular impulses and interests to the objects as
themselves particulars, and preserves himself in them,
inasmuch as he uses them, consumes them, and puts
in act his self-satisfaction by sacrificing them to it.
In this negative relation desire requires for itself not
merely the superficial appearance of external things,
but themselves in their concrete sensuous existence.
Mere pictures of the wood that it wants to use, or
of the animals that it wants to eat, would be of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
service to desire. Just as little is it possible for
desire to let the object subsist in its freedom. For
its impulse urges it just precisely to destroy this
independence and freedom of external things, and
to show that they are only there to be destroyed
and consumed. But, at the same time, the subject
himself, as entangled in the particular limited and
valueless interests of his desires, is neither free in
himself, for he does not determine himself out of
the essential universality and rationality of his will,
nor free in relation to the outer world, for his desire
remains essentially determined by things, and related
to them. This relation of desire is not that in which
man stands to the work of art. He allows it to
subsist as an object, free and independent, and enters
into relation with it apart from desire, as with an
object which only appeals to the theoretic side of
the mind. For this reason the work of art, although
it has sensuous existence, yet, in this point of view,
does not require concrete sensuous existence and
natural life; indeed, it even <i>ought</i> not to remain
on such a level, seeing that it has to satisfy only
the interests of mind, and is bound to exclude from
itself all desire. Hence it is, indeed, that practical
desire rates individual things in nature, organic and
inorganic, which are serviceable to it, higher than works
of art, which reveal themselves to be useless for its
purpose, and enjoyable only for other modes of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>(&beta;&beta;) A second mode in which the externally
present may be related to the mind is, in contrast
with singular sensuous perception and desire, the
purely theoretical relation to the <i>Intelligence</i>. The
theoretic contemplation of things has no interest in
consuming them as particulars, in satisfying itself
sensuously, and in preserving itself by their means,
but rather in becoming acquainted with them in their
universality, in finding their inner being and law, and
in conceiving them in terms of their notion. Therefore
the theoretical interest lets the single things be,
and holds aloof from them as sensuous particulars,
because this sensuous particularity is not what the
contemplation exercised by the intelligence looks for.
For the rational intelligence does not belong, as do the
desires, to the individual subject<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> as such, but only to
the individual as at the same time in his nature universal.
In as far as man has relation to things in respect
of this universality, it is his universal reason which
attempts to find himself in nature, and thereby to
reproduce the inner essence of things, which sensuous
existence, though having its ground therein, cannot
immediately display. But again, this theoretic interest,
the satisfaction of which is the work of science, is in
the scientific form no more shared by art, than the
latter makes common cause with the impulse of the
purely practical desires. Science may, no doubt, start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from the sensuous thing in its individuality, and may
possess a sensuous idea of the way in which such an
individual presents itself in its individual colour, shape,
size, etc. Still, this isolated sensuous thing, as such,
has no further relation to the mind, inasmuch as
the intelligence aims at the universal, the law, the
thought and notion of the object. Not only, therefore,
does it abandon all intercourse with the thing as a
given individual, but transforms it within the mind,
making a concrete object of sense into an abstract
matter of thought, and so into something quite other
than the same object <i>qua</i> sensuous phenomenon. The
artistic interest, as distinguished from science, does not
act thus. Artistic contemplation accepts the work of
art just as it displays itself <i>qua</i> external object, in
immediate determinateness and sensuous individuality
clothed in colour, figure, and sound, or as a single
isolated perception, etc., and does not go so far
beyond the immediate appearance of objectivity which
is presented before it, as to aim, like science, at apprehending
the notion of such an objective appearance
as a universal notion.</p>

<p>Thus, the interest of art distinguishes itself from
the practical interest of <i>desire</i> by the fact that it permits
its object to subsist freely and in independence,
while desire utilizes it in its own service by its
destruction. On the other hand, artistic contemplation
differs from theoretical consideration by the scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
intelligence, in cherishing interest for the object as an
individual existence, and not setting to work to transmute
it into its universal thought and notion.</p>

<p>&gamma;&gamma; It follows, then, from the above, that though
the sensuous must be present in a work of art, yet it
must only appear as surface and <i>semblance</i> of the
sensuous. For, in the sensuous aspect of a work of
art, the mind seeks neither the concrete framework of
matter, that empirically thorough completeness and
development of the organism which desire demands,
nor the universal and merely ideal thought. What it
requires is sensuous presence, which, while not ceasing
to be sensuous, is to be liberated from the apparatus
of its merely material nature. And thus the sensuous
in works of art is exalted to the rank of a mere
<i>semblance</i> in comparison with the immediate existence
of things in nature, and the work of art occupies the
mean between what is immediately sensuous and ideal
thought. This semblance of the sensuous presents
itself to the mind externally as the shape, the visible
look, and the sonorous vibration of things&mdash;supposing
that the mind leaves the objects uninterfered with
(physically), but yet does not descend into their inner
essence (by abstract thought), for if it did so, it would
entirely destroy their external existence as separate
individuals <i>for it</i>. For this reason the sensuous aspect
of art only refers to the two <i>theoretical</i> senses of <i>sight</i>
and <i>hearing</i>, while smell, taste, and feeling remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
excluded from being sources of artistic enjoyment.
For smell, taste, and feeling have to do with matter
as such, and with its immediate sensuous qualities;
smell with material volatilization in air, taste with
the material dissolution of substance,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and feeling with
warmth, coldness, smoothness, etc. On this account
these senses cannot have to do with the objects of art,
which are destined to maintain themselves in their
actual independent existence, and admit of no purely
sensuous relation. The pleasant for these latter senses
is not the beautiful in art. Thus art on its sensuous
side purposely produces no more than a shadow-world
of shapes, sounds, and imaginable ideas;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and
it is absolutely out of the question to maintain that
it is owing to simple powerlessness and to the limitations
on his actions that man, when evoking worlds
of art into existence, fails to present more than the
mere surface of the sensuous, than mere <i>schemata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
In art, these sensuous shapes and sounds present themselves,
not simply for their own sake and for that of
their immediate structure,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but with the purpose of
affording in that shape satisfaction to higher spiritual
interests, seeing that they are powerful to call forth
a response and echo in the mind from all the depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of consciousness. It is thus that, in art, the sensuous
is <i>spiritualized</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>spiritual</i> appears in sensuous
shape.</p>

<p>(&beta;) But for this very reason we have a product
of art only in so far as it has found a passage through
the mind, and has been generated by spiritually productive
activity. This leads us to the other question
which we have to answer&mdash;how, that is, the sensuous
side, which is indispensable to art, is operative in the
artist as a productive state of the subject or person.
This, the method and fashion of production, contains
in itself as a subjective activity just the same properties
which we found objectively present in the
work of art; it must be a spiritual activity which,
nevertheless, at the same time has in itself the element
of sensuousness and immediateness. It is neither,
on the one hand, purely mechanical work, as mere
unconscious skill in sensuous sleight of hand,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or
a formal activity according to fixed rules learnt by
rote; nor is it, on the other hand, a scientific productive
process, which passes from sense to abstract
ideas and thoughts, or exercises itself exclusively in
the element of pure thinking; rather the spiritual and
the sensuous side must in artistic production be as
one. For instance, it would be possible in poetical
creation to try and proceed by first apprehending
the theme to be treated as a prosaic thought, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
then putting it into pictorial ideas, and into rhyme,
and so forth; so that the pictorial element would
simply be hung upon the abstract reflections as an
ornament or decoration. Such a process could only
produce bad poetry, for in it there would be operative
as two <i>separate activities</i> that which in artistic production
has its right place only as undivided unity.</p>

<p>This genuine mode of production constitutes the
activity of artistic <i>fancy</i>. It is the rational element
which, <i>qua</i> spirit, only exists in as far as it actively
extrudes itself into consciousness, but yet does not
array before it what it bears within itself till it does
so in sensuous form. This activity has, therefore,
a spiritual import, which, however, it embodies in
sensuous shape. Such a process may be compared
with the habit even of a man with great experience
of the world, or, again, with that of a man of <i>esprit</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
or wit, who, although he has complete knowledge of
the main stakes of life, of the substantive interests
that hold men together, of what moves them, and
of what is the power that they recognize, yet neither
has himself apprehended this content in the form
of general rules, nor is able to explain it to others
in general reflections, but makes plain to himself and
to others what occupies his consciousness always in
particular cases, whether real or invented, in adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
instances, and the like. For in his ideas, everything
shapes itself into concrete images, determinate in time
and place, to which, therefore, names and other
external circumstances of all kinds must not be
wanting. Yet such a kind of imagination rather rests
on the recollection of states that he has gone through,
and of experiences that have befallen him, than is
creative in its own strength. His recollection preserves
and reproduces the individuality and external fashion
of occurrences that had such and such results with all
their external circumstances, and prevents the universal
from emerging in its own shape. But the productive
fancy of the <i>artist</i> is the fancy of a great mind and
heart, the apprehension and creation of ideas and of
shapes, and, indeed, the exhibition of the profoundest
and most universal human interests in the definite
sensuous mould of pictorial representation. From
this it follows at once, that in one aspect Fancy
unquestionably rests on natural gifts&mdash;speaking
generally, on talent&mdash;because its mode of production
requires a sensuous medium. It is true that we speak
in the same way of scientific "talent," but the sciences
only presuppose the universal capacity of thought,
which has not, like Fancy, a natural mode (as well as
an intellectual one), but abstracts just precisely from
all that is natural (or native) in an activity; and thus
it would be more correct to say that there is no
specifically scientific talent in the sense of a <i>mere</i>
natural endowment. Now, Fancy <i>has</i> in it a mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of instinct-like productiveness, inasmuch as the
essential plasticity and sensuousness of the work of
art must be subjectively present in the artist as
natural disposition and natural impulse, and, considering
that it is unconscious operation, must belong
to the natural element in man, as well as to the
rational. Of course, natural capacity leaves room
for other elements in talent and genius, for artistic
production is just as much of a spiritual and self-conscious
nature; we can but say that its spirituality
must, somehow, have an element of natural, plastic,
and formative tendency. For this reason, though
nearly every one can reach a certain point in an art,
yet, in order to go beyond this point, with which the
art in the strict sense begins, it is impossible to dispense
with native artistic talent of the highest order.</p>

<p>Considered as a natural endowment, moreover,
such talent reveals itself for the most part in early
youth, and is manifested in the impelling restlessness
that busies itself, with vivacity and industry, in
creating shapes in some particular sensuous medium,
and in seizing on this species of utterance and communication
as the only one, or as the chief and the
most suitable one. And thus, too, a precocious
technical facility, that up to a certain grade of attainment
is without effort, is a sign of natural talent.
A sculptor finds everything transmute itself into
shapes, and he soon begins to take up the clay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
model it. And, speaking generally, whatever men
of such talents have in their imagination, whatever
rouses and moves their inner nature, turns at once
into shape, drawing, melody, or poem.</p>

<p>(&gamma;) Thirdly, and to conclude: the <i>content</i> of art
is also in some respects borrowed from the sensuous,
from nature; or, in any case, even if the content
is of a spiritual kind, it can only be seized and fixed
by representing the spiritual fact, such as human
relations, in the shape of phenomena with external
reality.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III_Continued"></a>CHAPTER III. (<i>Continued</i>).</h2>

<p class="center">THE CONCEPTION OF ARTISTIC BEAUTY.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part II.&mdash;The End of Art.</span></p>


<p>3. The question then arises, what the interest
or the <i>End</i> is which man proposes to himself when
he reproduces such a content in the form of works
of art. This was the third point of view which we
set before us with reference to the work of art, and
the closer discussion of which will finally make the
transition to the actual and true conception of art.</p>

<p>If in this aspect we glance at the common consciousness,
a current idea which may occur to us is&mdash;</p>

<p>(&alpha;) The principle of the <i>imitation of nature</i>. According
to this view the essential purpose of art
consists in imitation, in the sense of a facility in copying
natural forms as they exist in a way that corresponds
precisely to them; and the success of such
a representation, exactly corresponding to nature,
is supposed to be what affords complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) This definition contains, <i>prima facie</i>, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
beyond the purely formal<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> aim that whatever already
exists in the external world, just <i>as</i> it is therein, is
now to be made a second time by man as a copy
of the former, as well as he can do it with the means
at his command. But we may at once regard this
repetition as&mdash;</p>

<p>(&alpha;&alpha;) A <i>superfluous</i> labour, seeing that the things
which pictures, theatrical representations, etc., imitate
and represent&mdash;animals, natural scenes, incidents in
human life&mdash;are before us in other cases already, in
our own gardens or our own houses, or in cases
within our closer or more remote circle of acquaintance.
And, looking more closely, we may regard
this superfluous labour as a presumptuous sport
which&mdash;</p>

<p>(&beta;&beta;) Comes far short of nature. For art is
restricted in its means of representation; and can
produce only <i>one-sided</i> deceptions, <i>i.e.</i> for instance,
a semblance of reality addressed to one sense only;
and, in fact, it invariably gives rise, if it rests in the
formal purpose of <i>mere imitation</i>, to a mere parody<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
of life, instead of a genuine vitality. Just so the
Turks, being Mohammedans, tolerate, as is well
known, no pictures copied from men or the like; and
when James Bruce, on his journey to Abyssinia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
showed paintings of fish to a Turk, the man was
amazed at first, but soon enough made answer: "If
this fish shall rise up against you on the last day, and
say, 'You have created for me a body, but no living
soul,' how will you defend yourself against such an
accusation?" The prophet, moreover, it is recorded in
the Sunna, said to the two women, Ommi Habiba
and Ommi Selma, who told him of pictures in
Æthiopian churches&mdash;"These pictures will accuse
their authors on the day of judgment!"</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, as well, examples of completely
deceptive imitation. Zeuxis' painted grapes
have from antiquity downward been taken to be
the triumph of this principle of the imitation of
nature, because the story is that living doves pecked
at them. We might add to this ancient example
the modern one of Büttner's monkey, which bit
in pieces a painted cockchafer in Rösel's "Diversions
of the Insect World," and was pardoned by
his master, in spite of his having thereby spoilt
a beautiful copy of this valuable work, because
of this proof of the excellence of the pictures. But
when we reflect on these and similar instances, it
must at once occur to us that, in place of commending
works of art because they have <i>actually</i>
deceived <i>even</i> pigeons and monkeys, we ought simply
to censure the people who mean to exalt a work
of art by predicating, as its highest and ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
quality, so poor an effect as this. In general, we
may sum up by saying that, as a matter of mere
imitation, art cannot maintain a rivalry with nature,
and, if it tries, must look like a worm trying to crawl
after an elephant.</p>

<p>(&gamma;&gamma;) Considering the unvarying failure&mdash;comparative
failure, at least&mdash;of imitation when contrasted
with the original in nature, there remains as end
nothing beyond our pleasure in the sleight of hand<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
which can produce something so like nature. And
it is doubtless open to man to be pleased at producing
over again what is already present in its own right,
by his labour, skill, and industry. But enjoyment
and admiration, even of this kind, naturally grow
frigid or chilled precisely in proportion to the resemblance
of the copy to the natural type, or are even
converted into tedium and repugnance. There are
portraits which, as has been wittily said, are sickeningly
like; and Kant adduces another instance
relative to this pleasure in imitation as such, viz. that
we soon grow tired of a man&mdash;and there are such
men&mdash;who is able to mimic the nightingale's strain
quite perfectly; and as soon as it is discovered that
a man is producing the notes, we are at once weary
of the song. We then recognize in it nothing but
a conjuring trick, neither the free production of
nature, nor a work of art; for we expect from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
free productive capacity of human beings something
quite other than such music as this, which only
interests us when, as is the case with the nightingale's
note, it gushes forth from the creature's own vitality
without special purpose, and yet recalls the utterance
of human feeling. In general, such delight at our
skill in mimicking can be but limited, and it becomes
man better to take delight in what he produces out
of himself. In this sense the invention of any unimportant
and technical product has the higher value,
and man may be prouder of having invented the
hammer, the nail, and so forth, than of achieving
feats of mimicry. For this fervour of abstract<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> copying
is to be evened with the feat of the man who had
taught himself to throw lentils through a small
opening without missing. He displayed this skill
of his before Alexander, and Alexander presented
him with a bushel of lentils as a reward for his
frivolous and meaningless art.</p>

<p>(&beta;) Moreover, seeing that the principle of imitation
is purely formal, to make it the end has the result that
<i>objective beauty</i> itself disappears. For the question is
in that case no longer <i>of what nature</i> that is which is
to be copied, but only whether it is <i>correctly</i> copied.
The object and content of the beautiful comes then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
be regarded as matter of entire indifference. That is
to say, if we go outside the principle and speak of a
difference of beauty and ugliness in considering beasts,
men, landscapes, actions, or characters, this must
nevertheless, in presence of the maxim in question,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
be set down as a distinction that does not belong
particularly to art, for which nothing is left but abstract
imitation. In this case the above-mentioned
lack of a criterion in dealing with the endless forms
of nature reduces us, as regards the selection of objects
and their distinction in beauty and ugliness, to subjective
<i>taste</i> as an ultimate fact, which accepts no rule
and admits of no discussion. And, in fact, if in selecting
objects for representation we start from what <i>men</i>
think beautiful or ugly, and therefore deserving artistic
imitation&mdash;that is, from their taste,&mdash;then all circles of
natural objects open to us, and not one of them will
be likely to fail of a patron. Among men, for instance,
it is the case that at any rate every bridegroom
thinks his bride beautiful, and indeed, perhaps, he
alone; though not, it may be, every husband his wife;
and that subjective taste for such beauty has no fixed
rule one may hold to be the good fortune of both
parties. If we, moreover, look quite beyond individuals
and their accidental taste, to the taste of
nations, this again is full of extreme diversity and
contrast. How often we hear it said that a European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
beauty would not please a Chinese or even a Hottentot,
in as far as the Chinaman has quite a different
conception of beauty from the negro, and the negro
in turn from the European, and so forth. Indeed, if
we look at the works of art of those extra-European
peoples&mdash;their images of the gods, for instance&mdash;which
their fancy has originated as venerable and sublime,
they may appear to us as the most gruesome idols,
and their music may sound to our ears as the most
horrible noise; while they, on their side, will regard our
sculptures, paintings, and musical productions as trivial
or ugly.</p>

<p>(&gamma;) But even if we abstract from an objective
principle of art, and if beauty is to be based on subjective
and individual taste, we shall still soon find on
the side of art itself that the imitation of nature,
which certainly appeared to be a universal principle
and one guaranteed by high authority, is at any rate
not to be accepted in this universal and merely abstract
form. For if we look at the different arts it will at
once be admitted that even if painting and sculpture
represent objects which appear like those of nature, or
the type of which is essentially borrowed from nature,
yet works of architecture on the other hand&mdash;and
architecture belongs to the fine arts&mdash;and the productions
of poetry, in as far as they do not confine
themselves to mere description, are by no means to
be called imitations of nature. At least, if we desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to maintain the principle as valid in the case of these
latter arts, we should have to make a long circuit by
conditioning the proposition in various ways, and
reducing the so-called truth<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> at any rate to probability.
But if we admitted probability we should
again be met by a great difficulty in determining
what is probable and what is not; and still, moreover,
one would neither consent nor find it possible to exclude
from poetry all wholly arbitrary and completely
original<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> imaginations.</p>

<p>The end of art must, therefore, lie in something
different from the purely formal<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> imitation of what
we find given, which in any case can bring to the birth
only <i>tricks</i> and not <i>works</i> of art. It is, indeed, an
element essential to the work of art to have natural
shapes for its foundation; seeing that its representation
is in the medium of external and therefore of
natural phenomena. In painting, for instance, it is an
important study to know how to copy with precision
the colours in their relations to one another, the effects
of light, reflections, etc., and, no less, the forms and
figures of objects down to their subtlest characteristics.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
It is in this respect chiefly that the principle of naturalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
in general and of copying nature has recovered its
influence in modern times. Its aim is to recall an art
which has grown feeble and indistinct to the vigour
and crispness of nature; or, again, to invoke against
the purely arbitrary and artificial conventionalism, as
unnatural as it was inartistic, into which art had strayed,
the uniform, direct, and solidly coherent sequences of
nature. But however true it is that there is something
right in this endeavour from one point of view, yet still
the naturalism at which it aims is not as such the substantive
and primary concern that underlies fine art.
And, therefore, although external appearance in the
shape of natural reality constitutes an essential condition
of art, yet, nevertheless, neither is the given
natural world its <i>rule</i>, nor is the mere imitation of
external appearance <i>as</i> external its <i>end</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The further question then arises&mdash;What <i>is</i> the
true content of art, and with what aim is this content
to be presented. On this subject our consciousness
supplies us with the common opinion that it is the
task and aim of art to bring in contact with our sense,
our feeling, our inspiration, <i>all</i> that finds a place in
the mind of man. Art, it is thought, should realize
in us that familiar saying, "Homo sum: humani
nihil a me alienum puto." Its aim is therefore placed
in arousing and animating the slumbering emotions,
inclinations, and passions; in filling the <i>heart</i>,
in forcing the human being, whether cultured or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
uncultured, to feel the whole range of what man's
soul in its inmost and secret corners has power
to experience and to create, and all that is able to
move and to stir the human breast in its depths and
in its manifold aspects and possibilities; to present
as a delight to emotion and to perception all that
the mind possesses of real and lofty in its thought
and in the Idea&mdash;all the splendour of the noble, the
eternal, and the true; and no less to make intelligible
misfortune and misery, wickedness and crime; to
make men realize the inmost nature of all that is
shocking and horrible, as also of all pleasure and
delight; and, finally, to set imagination roving in
idle toyings of fancy, and luxuriating in the seductive
spells of sense-stimulating visions. This endlessly
varied content, it is held, art is bound to embrace,
partly in order to complete the natural experience
in which our external existence consists, and partly
with the general aim of provoking the passions of
our nature, both in order that the experiences of life
may not leave us unmoved, and because we desire to
attain to a receptivity that welcomes all phenomena.
Now, such a stimulus is not given in this sphere
by actual experience itself, but can only come by
the semblance thereof, by art, that is, deceptively
substituting its creations for reality. The possibility
of this deception by means of artistic semblance rests
on the fact that all reality must, for man, traverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the medium of perception and ideas, and cannot
otherwise penetrate the feelings and the will. In
this process it is quite indifferent whether his attention
is claimed by immediate external reality, or
whether this effect is produced by another means&mdash;that
is, by images, symbols, and ideas, containing or
representing <i>the content</i> of reality. Man can frame
to himself ideas of things that are not actual as
though they were actual. Hence it is all the same
to our feelings whether external reality or only the
semblance of it is the means of bringing in contact
with us a situation, a relation, or the import of a life.
Either mode suffices to awaken our response to its
burden, in grief and in rejoicing, in pathos and
in horror,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and in traversing the emotions and the
passions of wrath, hatred, compassion, of anxiety,
fear, love, reverence, and admiration, or of the desire
of honour and of fame.</p>

<p>This awakening of all feelings in us, the dragging
of the heart through the whole significance of life, the
realization of all such inner movements by means of
a presented exterior consisting merely in deception&mdash;all
this was what, from the point of view which we
have been considering, constituted the peculiar and
pre-eminent power of art.</p>

<p>Now, as this mode of treatment credits art with
the vocation of impressing on the heart and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
imagination good and bad alike, and of strengthening
man to the noblest, as of enervating him to the most
sensuous and selfish emotions, it follows that the task
set before art is still purely formal, and so it would
have no certain purpose, but would merely furnish
the empty form for every possible kind of significance
and content.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is a fact that art does include this formal
side, in that it has power to present every possible
subject-matter in artistic dress, before perception and
feeling, just exactly as argumentative<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> reflection has
the power of manipulating all possible objects and
modes of action, and of furnishing them with reasons
and justifications. But when we admit so great a
variety of content we are at once met by the remark
that the manifold feelings and ideas, which art aims
at provoking or reinforcing, intersect and contradict,
and by mutual interference cancel one another.
Indeed, in this aspect, in so far as art inspires men
to directly opposite emotions, it only magnifies the
contradiction of our feelings and passions, and either
sets them staggering like Bacchantes, or passes into
sophistry and scepticism, in the same way as argumentation.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
This diversity of the material of art itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
compels us, therefore, not to be content with so formal<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
an aim for it, seeing that rationality forces its way into
this wild diversity, and demands to see the emergence
of a higher and more universal purpose from these
elements in spite of their self-contradiction, and to
be assured of its being attained. Just in the same
way the State and the social life of men are, of course,
credited with the purpose that in them <i>all</i> human
capacities and <i>all</i> individual powers are to be
developed and to find utterance in <i>all</i> directions and
with <i>all</i> tendencies. But in opposition to so formal
a view there at once arises the question in what <i>unity</i>
these manifold formations must be comprehended,
and what <i>single end</i> they must have for their
fundamental idea and ultimate purpose.</p>

<p>As such an end, reflection soon suggests the notion
that art has the capacity and the function of mitigating
the fierceness of the desires.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) In respect to this first idea, we have only to
ascertain in what feature peculiar to art it is that the
capacity lies of eliminating brutality and taming and
educating the impulses, desires, and passions. Brutality
in general has its reason in a direct selfishness
of the impulses, which go to work right away, and
exclusively for the satisfaction of their concupiscence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Now, desire is most savage and imperious in proportion
as, being isolated and narrow, it occupies the
<i>whole man</i>, so that he does not retain the power
of separating himself as a universal being from this
determinateness, and becoming aware of himself as
universal. Even if the man in such a case says, "The
passion is stronger than I," it is true that the abstract
I is then separated for consciousness from the particular
passion; but still only in a formal way, inasmuch
as this separation is only made in order to pronounce
that, against the power of the passion, the I as such
is of no account whatever. The savageness of passion
consists, therefore, in the oneness of the I as universal
with the limited content of its desires, so that the
man has no will outside this particular passion. Now,
such brutality and untamed violence of passion is
softened through art, to begin with, by the mere fact
that it brings before the man as an idea what in such
a state he feels and does. And even if art restricts
itself to merely setting up pictures of the passions
before the mind's eye, or even if it were actually to
flatter them, still this is by itself enough to have a
softening power, inasmuch as the man is thereby at
least <i>made aware</i>, of what, apart from such presentation,
he simply <i>is</i>. For then the man observes his
impulses and inclinations, and whereas before they
bore him on without power of reflection, he now sees
them outside himself, and begins already to be free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from them, in so far as they form an object which
he contrasts with himself. Hence it may frequently
be the case with the artist that when attacked by
grief he softens and weakens the intensity of his
own feelings in its effect on his own mind by representing
it in art. Tears, even, are enough to bring
comfort; the man, who to begin with is utterly sunk
and concentrated in grief, is able thus, at any rate,
to utter in a direct fashion this his inner state.
Still more of a relief however, is the utterance of
what is within in words, images, pictures, sounds, and
shapes. For this reason it was a good old custom
at deaths and funerals to appoint wailing women, in
order to bring the grief before the mind in its utterance.
Manifestations of sympathy, too, hold up the
content of a man's misfortune to his view; when it is
much talked about he is forced to reflect upon it, and
is thereby relieved. And so it has always been held
that to weep or to speak one's fill is a means to
obtain freedom from the oppressive weight of care,
or at least to find momentary relief for the heart.
Hence the mitigation of the violence of passion has
for its universal reason that man is released from his
immediate sunkenness<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in a feeling, and becomes
conscious of it as of something external to him,
towards which he must now enter into an <i>ideal</i>
relation. Art, by means of its representations, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
remaining within the sensuous sphere, delivers man
at the same time from the power of sensuousness.
Of course we may often hear those favourite phrases
about man's duty being to remain in immediate
oneness with nature, but such oneness in its abstraction
is simply and solely coarseness and savagery;
and art, in the very process of dissolving this oneness
for man, is raising him with gentle hand above and
away from mere sunkenness in nature. Man's mode
of occupying himself with works of art is always
purely contemplative,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and educates thereby, in the
first place, no doubt, merely attention to the representations
themselves, but then, going beyond this,
it cultivates attention to their significance, the power
of comparison with other contents, and receptivity for
the general consideration of them, and for the points
of view which it involves.</p>

<p>(&beta;) To the above there attaches itself in natural
connection the second characteristic which has been
ascribed to art as its essential purpose, viz. the <i>purification</i>
of the passions, instruction and <i>moral</i> perfecting.
For the characteristic that art was to bridle
savageness and educate the passions remained quite
abstract and general, so that a question must again
arise about a <i>determinate</i> kind and an essential <i>end</i> of
this education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>(&alpha;&alpha;) The doctrine of the purification of passion
suffers indeed under the same defect as the above
doctrine of the mitigation of the desires; yet, when
more closely looked at, it at any rate arrives at the
point of accentuating the fact that the representations
of art may be held to lack a standard by which
their worth or unworthiness could be measured. This
standard simply means their effectiveness in separating
pure from impure in the passions. It therefore requires
a content that has capacity to exercise this purifying
power, and, in as far as the production of such an
effect is taken to constitute the substantive end of
art, it must follow that the purifying content must be
brought before consciousness in its <i>universality</i> and
<i>essentiality</i>.</p>

<p>(&beta;&beta;) In this latter aspect the end of art has been
pronounced to be that it should <i>teach</i>. Thus, on the
one side, the peculiar character of art would consist in
the movement of the emotions and in the satisfaction
which lies in this movement, even in fear, compassion,
in painful pathos and shock&mdash;that is to say, in the
satisfying engagement of the emotions and passions,
and to that extent in a complacency, entertainment,
and delight in the objects of art, in their representation
and effect; but, on the other side, this purpose (of
art) is held to find its higher standard only in its
instructiveness, in the <i>fabula docet</i>,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and thus in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
useful influence which the work of art succeeds in
exerting on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In this respect the Horatian
saw,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> "Et prodesse volunt et delectare poetæ,"
("Poets aim at utility and entertainment alike") contains,
concentrated in a few words, all that has subsequently
been elaborated in infinite degrees, and diluted
into the uttermost extreme of insipidity as a doctrine
of art. As regards such instruction we have, then, to
ask, whether it is meant to be directly or indirectly,
explicitly or implicitly contained in the work of
art.</p>

<p>If, speaking generally, we are concerned about a
purpose which is universal and not contingent, it
follows that this purpose, considering the essentially
spiritual nature of art, cannot but be itself spiritual,
and indeed, moreover, one which is not contingent,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
but actual in its nature and for its own sake. Such a
purpose in relation to teaching could only consist in
bringing before consciousness, by help of the work of
art, a really and explicitly significant spiritual content.
From this point of view it is to be asserted that the
higher art ranks itself, the more it is bound to admit
into itself such a content as this, and that only in the
essence of such a content can it find the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
which determines whether what is expressed is appropriate
or inappropriate. Art was, in fact, the first
<i>instructress</i> of peoples.</p>

<p>But the purpose of instruction may be treated as
<i>purpose</i>, to such a degree that the universal nature of
the represented content is doomed to be exhibited
and expounded directly and obviously as abstract
proposition, prosaic reflection, or general theorem,
and not merely in an indirect way in the concrete
form of a work of art. By such a severance the
sensuous plastic form, which is just what makes the
work of art a work of <i>art</i>, becomes a mere otiose
accessory, a husk which is expressly pronounced to
be mere husk, a semblance expressly pronounced to be
mere semblance. But thereby the very nature of the
work of art is distorted. For the work of art ought
to bring a content before the mind's eye, not in its
generality as such, but with this generality made absolutely
individual, and sensuously particularized. If
the work of art does not proceed from this principle,
but sets in relief its generalized aspect with the purpose
of abstract instruction, then the imaginative and
sensuous aspect is only an external and superfluous
adornment, and the work of art is a thing divided
against itself,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> in which form and content no longer
appear as grown into one. In that case the sensuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
individual and the spiritually general are become external
to one another.</p>

<p>And further, if the purpose of art is limited to this
<i>didactic</i> utility, then its other aspect, that of pleasure,
entertainment, and delight, is pronounced to be in
itself <i>unessential</i>, and ought to have its substance
merely in the utility of the teaching on which it is
attendant. But this amounts to pronouncing that art
does not bear its vocation and purpose in itself, but
that its conception is rooted in something else, to
which it is a <i>means</i>. Art is, in this case, only one
among the several means which prove useful and are
applied for the purpose of instruction. This brings
us to the boundary at which art is made no longer to
be an end on its own merits, seeing that it is degraded
into a mere toy of entertainment or a mere means of
instruction.</p>

<p>(&gamma;&gamma;) This boundary becomes most sharply marked
when a question is raised, in its turn, about a supreme
end and aim for the sake of which the passions are to
be purified and men are to be instructed. This aim
has often, in modern times, been declared to be <i>moral</i>
improvement, and the aim of art has been placed in
the function of preparing the inclinations and impulses
for moral perfection, and of leading them to this goal.
This idea combines purification with instruction, inasmuch
as art is, by communicating an insight into
genuine moral goodness&mdash;that is, by instruction,&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the same time to incite to purification, and in this way
alone to bring about the improvement of mankind as
its useful purpose and supreme goal.</p>

<p>Regarding art in reference to moral improvement,
the same has <i>prima facie</i> to be said as about the
didactic purpose. We may readily grant that art
must not as a principle take for its aim the immoral
and its furtherance. But it is one thing to take immorality
for the express aim of representation, and
another to abstain from taking morality. Every
genuine work of art may have a good moral drawn
from it, but, of course, in doing so much depends on
interpretation and on him who draws the moral.
Thus one may hear the most immoral representations
defended by saying that we must know evil, or sin, in
order to act morally; and, conversely, it has been said
that the portrayal of Mary Magdalene, the beautiful
sinner who afterwards repented, has seduced many
into sin, because art makes it look so beautiful to
repent, and you must sin before you can repent. But
the doctrine of moral improvement, if consistently
carried out, goes in general yet further. It would not
be satisfied with the possibility of extracting a moral
from a work of art by interpretation, but it would, on
the contrary, display the moral instruction as the substantive
purpose of the work of art, and, indeed, would
actually admit to portrayal none but moral subjects,
moral characters, actions, and incidents. For art has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the choice among its subjects, in contradistinction to
history or the sciences which have their matter fixed
for them.</p>

<p>In order that we may be able to form a thoroughly
adequate estimate of the idea that the aim of art is
moral from this point of view, we must inquire first of
all for the definite standpoint of the morality on which
this doctrine is based. If we look closely at the standpoint
of morality as we have to understand it in the
best sense at the present day, we soon find that its
conception does not immediately coincide with what
apart from it we are in the habit of calling in a general
way virtue, respectability,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> uprightness, etc. To be
respectable and virtuous is not enough to make a
man moral.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Morality involves <i>reflection</i> and the
definite consciousness of that which duty prescribes,
and acting out of such a prior consciousness. Duty
itself is the law of the will, which man nevertheless
lays down freely out of his own self, and then is
supposed to determine himself to this duty for duty's
and its fulfilment's sake, by doing good solely from
the conviction which he has attained that it is the
good. Now this law, the duty which is chosen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
duty's sake to be the guide of action, out of free
conviction and the inner conscience, and is then acted
upon, is, taken by itself,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the abstract universal of the
will, and is the direct antithesis of nature, the sensuous
impulses, the self-seeking interests, the passions, and
of all that is comprehensively entitled the feelings<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and the heart. In this antagonism the one side is
regarded as <i>negativing</i> the other; and, seeing that
both are present as antagonists within the subject
(person), he has, as determining himself out of himself,
the choice of following the one or the other. But,
according to the view under discussion, a <i>moral</i> aspect
is acquired by such a decision, and by the act performed
in accordance with it, only through the free conviction
of duty on the one hand, and, on the other hand, through
the conquest, not only of the particular or separate will,
of the natural motives, inclinations, passions, etc., but
also through that of the nobler emotions and the
higher impulses. For the modern moralistic view
starts from the fixed antithesis of the will in its
spiritual universality to its sensuous natural particularity,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
and consists not in the completed reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of these contrasted sides, but in their conflict with
one another, which involves the requirement that the
impulses which conflict with duty ought to yield to it.</p>

<p>This antithesis does not merely display itself for
our consciousness, in the limited region of moral
action; but also emerges as a fundamental distinction
and antagonism between that which is real
essentially and in its own right,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and that which
is external reality and existence. Formulated in the
abstract, it is the contrast of the universal and particular,
when the former is explicitly fixed over against
the latter, just as the latter is over against the former;
more concretely, it appears in nature as the opposition
of the abstract law against the abundance of individual
phenomena, each having its own character; in the
mind, as the sensuous and spiritual in man, as the
battle of the spirit against the flesh, of duty for duty's
sake, the cold command, with the individual interest,
the warm feelings, the sensuous inclinations and
impulses, the individual disposition as such; as the
hard conflict of inward freedom and of natural
necessity; further, as the contradiction of the dead
conception&mdash;empty in itself&mdash;compared with full
concrete vitality, or of theory and subjective thought
contrasted with objective existence and experience.</p>

<p>These are antitheses which have not been invented,
either by the subtlety of reflection or by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pedantry of philosophy, but which have from all time
and in manifold forms preoccupied and disquieted
the human consciousness, although it was modern
culture that elaborated them most distinctly, and
forced them up to the point of most unbending contradiction.
Intellectual culture and the modern play
of understanding create in man this contrast, which
makes him an amphibious animal, inasmuch as it
sets him to live in two contradictory worlds at once;
so that even consciousness wanders back and forward
in this contradiction, and, shuttle-cocked from side
to side, is unable to satisfy itself <i>as</i> itself on the one
side as on the other. For, on the one side, we see
man a prisoner in common reality and earthly temporality,
oppressed by want and poverty, hard driven
by nature, entangled in matter, in sensuous aims and
their enjoyments; on the other side, he exalts himself
to eternal ideas, to a realm of thought and freedom,
imposes on himself as a <i>will</i> universal laws and
attributions, strips the world of its living and flourishing
reality and dissolves it into abstractions, inasmuch
as the mind is put upon vindicating its rights and its
dignity simply by denying the rights of nature and
maltreating it, thereby retaliating the oppression and
violence which itself has experienced from nature.
Such a discrepancy in life and consciousness involves
for modern culture and its understanding the demand
that the contradiction should be resolved. Yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
understanding cannot release itself from the fixity of
these antitheses. The solution, therefore, remains for
consciousness a mere <i>ought</i>, and the present and
reality only stir themselves in the unrest of a perpetual
to and fro, which seeks a reconciliation without
finding it. Then the question arises, whether
such a many-sided and fundamental opposition which
never gets beyond a mere ought and a postulated
solution, can be the genuine and complete<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> truth,
and, in general, the supreme purpose. If the culture
of the world<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> has fallen into such a contradiction,
it becomes the task of philosophy to undo or cancel
it, <i>i.e.</i> to show that neither the one alternative in its
abstraction nor the other in similar one-sidedness
possesses truth, but that they are essentially self-dissolving;
that truth only lies in the conciliation and
mediation of the two, and that this mediation is no
mere postulate, but is in its nature and in reality
accomplished and always self-accomplishing. This
intuition agrees directly with the natural faith and
will, which always has present to the mind's eye precisely
this resolved antithesis, and in action makes it
its purpose and achieves it. All that philosophy
does is to furnish a reflective insight into the essence
of the antithesis in as far as it shows that what constitutes
truth is merely the resolution of this antithesis,
and that not in the sense that the conflict and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
aspects in any way <i>are not</i>, but in the sense that they
<i>are</i>, <i>in reconciliation</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Now, as an ultimate aim implied a higher standpoint
in the case of moral improvement, we shall
have to vindicate this higher standpoint for art no
less than for morals. Thereby we at once lay aside
the false position, which has already been remarked
upon, that art has to serve as a means for moral ends,
and to conduce to the moral end of the world, as
such, by instruction and moral improvement, and
thereby has its substantive aim, not in itself, but in
something else. If, therefore, we now continue to
speak of an aim or purpose, we must, in the first
instance, get rid of the perverse idea, which, in asking
"What is the aim?" retains the accessory meaning
of the question, "What is the <i>use</i>?". The perverseness
of this lies in the point that the work of art would
then be regarded as aspiring to something else which
is set before consciousness as the essential and as
what ought to be; so that then the work of art would
only have value as a useful instrument in the realization
of an end having substantive importance <i>outside</i>
the sphere of art. Against this it is necessary to
maintain that art has the vocation of revealing <i>the
truth</i> in the form of sensuous artistic shape, of representing
the reconciled antithesis just described, and,
therefore, has its purpose in itself, in this representation
and revelation. For other objects, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
instruction, purification, improvement, pecuniary gain,
endeavour after fame and honour, have nothing to do
with the work of art as such, and do not determine
its conception.</p>

<p>It is from this point of view, into which <i>reflective</i>
consideration of the matter resolves itself, that we
have to apprehend the idea of art in its inner
necessity, as indeed it was from this point of view,
historically speaking, that the true appreciation and
understanding of art took its origin. For that antithesis,
of which we spoke, made itself felt, not only
within general reflective culture, but no less in
philosophy as such, and it was not till philosophy
discovered how to overcome this antithesis absolutely,
that it grasped its own conception and, just in as
far as it did so, the conception of nature and of art.</p>

<p>Hence this point of view, as it is the re-awakening
of philosophy in general, so also is the re-awakening of
the science of art; and, indeed, it is this re-awakening
to which alone æsthetic as a science owes its true
origin, and art its higher estimation.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">HISTORICAL DEDUCTION OF THE TRUE IDEA OF
ART IN MODERN PHILOSOPHY.</p>


<p>I Shall touch briefly upon the historical side of
the transition above alluded to, partly for its historical
interest, partly because, in doing so, we shall
more closely indicate the critical points which are
important, and on the foundation of which we mean
to continue our structure. In its most general formulation,
this basis consists in recognizing artistic beauty
as one of the means which resolve and reduce to unity
the above antithesis and contradiction between the
abstract self-concentrated mind and actual nature,
whether that of external phenomena, or the inner
subjective feelings and emotions.</p>

<p>1. The Kantian philosophy led the way by not
merely feeling the lack of this point of union, but
attaining definite knowledge of it, and bringing it within
the range of our ideas.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In general, Kant treated
as his foundation for the intelligence as for the will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the self-related rationality or freedom, the self-consciousness
that finds and knows itself in itself as infinite.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
This knowledge of the absoluteness of reason
in itself which has brought philosophy to its turning-point
in modern times, this absolute beginning, deserves
recognition even if we pronounce Kant's philosophy
inadequate, and is an element in it which cannot be
refuted. But, in as far as Kant fell back again into
the fixed antithesis of subjective thought and objective
things, of the abstract universality and the sensuous
individuality of the will, it was he more especially who
strained to the highest possible pitch the above-mentioned
contradiction called morality,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> seeing that
he moreover exalted the practical side of the mind
above the theoretical. In presence of this fixed
antithesis, with its fixity acknowledged by the understanding,
he had no course open but to propound the
unity merely in the form of subjective ideas of the
reason to which no adequate reality could be shown
to correspond, or again, to treat it as consisting in
postulates which might indeed be deduced from the
practical reason, but whose essential nature<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> was not
for him knowable by thought, and whose practical
accomplishment remained a mere ought deferred to
infinity. Thus, then, Kant no doubt brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
reconciled contradiction within the range of our ideas,
but he succeeded neither in scientifically unfolding
its genuine essence nor in presenting it as the
true and sole reality. Kant indeed pressed on still
further, inasmuch as he recognized the required unity
in what he called the <i>intuitive understanding</i>; but
here, again, he comes to a standstill in the contradiction
of subjectivity and objectivity, so that although he
suggests in the abstract a solution of the contradiction
of concept and reality, universality and particularity,
understanding and sense, and thereby points to the
Idea, yet, on the other hand, he makes this solution
and reconciliation itself a purely <i>subjective</i> one, not
one which is true and actual in its nature and on its
own merits.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In this respect the Critique of the
power of judgment, in which he treats of the æsthetic
and teleological powers of judgment, is instructive
and remarkable. The beautiful objects of nature and
art, the rightly adapted products of nature, by connecting
which Kant is led to a closer treatment of
organic and animated beings, are regarded by him
only from the point of view of the reflection which
subjectively judges of them. Indeed Kant defines the
power of judgment generally as "the power of thinking
the particular as contained under the universal;"
and he calls the power of judgment <i>reflective</i> "when
it has only the particular given to it, and has to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the universal under which it comes." To this end it
requires a law, a principle, which it has to impose
upon itself; and Kant suggests as this law that of
<i>Teleology</i>. In the idea of freedom that belongs to the
practical reason, the accomplishment of the end is
left as a mere "ought," but in the teleological judgment
dealing with animated beings, Kant hits on the
notion of regarding the living organism in the light
that in it the idea, the universal, contains the particulars
as well. Thus in its capacity as end, it determines
the particular and external, the structure of the limbs,
not from without, but from within, and in the sense
that the particular conforms to the end <i>spontaneously</i>.
Yet even in such a judgment, again, we are supposed
not to know the objective nature of the thing, but
only to be enunciating a subjective mode of reflection.
Similarly, Kant understands the <i>æsthetic</i> judgment as
neither proceeding from the understanding as such
<i>qua</i> the faculty of ideas, nor from sensuous perception
as such with its manifold variety, but from the free
play of the understanding and of the imagination. It
is in this free agreement of the faculties of knowledge,
that the thing is related to the subject or person, and
to his feeling of pleasure and complacency.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Now this complacency is, in the first place, to
be devoid of any interest, i.e., <i>devoid of relation to our
appetitive faculty</i>. If we have an interest, by way of
curiosity for instance, or a sensuous interest on behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of our sensuous want, a desire of possession and use,
then the objects are not important to us for their own
sake, but for the sake of our want. In that case,
what exists has a value only with reference to such a
want, and the relation is of such a kind that the object
is on the one side, and on the other stands an attribution
which is distinct from the object, but to which
we relate it. If, for instance, I consume the object in
order to nourish myself by it, this interest lies only in
me, and remains foreign to the object itself. Now,
what Kant asserts is, that the relation to the beautiful
is not of this kind. The æsthetic judgment allows the
external existence to subsist free and independent,
giving licence to the object to have its end in itself.
This is, as we saw above, an important consideration.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The beautiful, in <i>the second place</i>, says Kant,
is definable as that which, without a conception, <i>i.e.</i>
without a category of the understanding, is perceived
as the object of a <i>universal</i> delight. To estimate
the beautiful requires a cultivated mind; the natural
man<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has no judgment about the beautiful, seeing
that this judgment claims universal validity. The
universal is, indeed to begin with, <i>as such</i> an abstraction;
but that which in itself and on its own merits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
is true, bears in itself the attribution and the claim to
be valid even universally. In this sense the beautiful,
too, ought to be <i>universally</i> recognized, although the
mere conceptions of the understanding are competent
to no judgment thereupon. The good, that, for instance,
which is right in particular actions, is subsumed under
universal conceptions, and the act passes for good
when it succeeds in corresponding to these conceptions.
Beauty, on the other hand, according to the
theory, should awaken a universal delight directly,
without any such relation. This amounts to nothing
else than that, in contemplating beauty, we are not
conscious of the conception and of the subsumption
under it, and do not permit to take place the severance
of the individual object and of the universal conception
which in all other cases is present in the judgment.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In the <i>third</i> place, the beautiful (Kant says) has
the form of teleology,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in as far as a teleological
character is perceived in the object without the idea
of an end. At bottom this only repeats the view
which we have just discussed. Any natural production,
<i>i.e.</i> a plant or an animal, is organized teleologically,
and is so immediately a datum to us in this
its teleology that we have no separate abstract idea of
the end, distinct from its given reality. It is in this
way that even <i>the beautiful</i> is to be displayed to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
as teleological. In finite teleology<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> end and means
remain external to one another, inasmuch as the end
stands in no essential inner relation to the material
medium of its accomplishment. In this case, the idea
of the end in its abstraction<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> distinguishes itself from
the object in which the end appears as realized. The
beautiful, on the other hand, exists as teleological in
itself, without means and end revealing themselves
in it as distinct aspects. For instance, the purpose of
the limbs of an organism is the vitality which exists
as actual in the limbs themselves; separately they
cease to be limbs. For in the living thing the end
and the material medium of the end are so directly
united, that the existing being only exists so long as
its purpose dwells in it. The beautiful, Kant maintains,
when considered from this point of view, does
not wear its teleology as an external form attached to
it; but the teleological correspondence of the inner
and outer is the immanent nature of the beautiful
object.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Lastly, Kant's treatment determines the beautiful,
in the <i>fourth</i> place, as being recognized, without a
conception, as object of a <i>necessary</i> delight. Necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is an abstract category, and indicates an inner essential
relation of two aspects; <i>if</i> the one is, and
<i>because</i> the one is, <i>then</i> (<i>and therefore</i>) the other is.
The one in its nature involves the other as well as
itself, just as cause, <i>e.g.</i>, has no meaning without effect.
The delight which the beautiful involves is such a
necessary consequence, wholly without relation to
conceptions, <i>i.e.</i> to categories of the understanding.
Thus, for instance, we are pleased no doubt by what
is symmetrical, and this is constructed in accordance
with a conception of the understanding. But Kant
requires, to give us pleasure, even more than the unity
and equality that belong to such a conception of the
understanding.</p>

<p>Now, what we find in all these Kantian laws is
a non-severance of that which in all other cases is presupposed
in our consciousness to be distinct. In the
beautiful this severance finds itself cancelled, inasmuch
as universal and particular, end and means, conception
and object thoroughly interpenetrate one another.
And thus, again, Kant regards the beautiful in <i>art</i> as
an agreement in which the particular itself <i>is</i> in
accordance with the conception. Particulars, as such,
are <i>prima facie</i> contingent, both as regards one another
and as regards the universal, and this very contingent
element, sense, feeling, temper, inclination, is now in
the beauty of art not merely <i>subsumed</i> under universal
categories of the understanding and <i>controlled</i> by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
conception of feeling in its abstract universality, but
so united with the universal that it reveals itself as
inwardly and in its nature and realization<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> adequate
thereto. By this means the beauty of art becomes
embodiment of a thought, and the material is not
externally determined by this thought, but exists
itself in its freedom. For in this case the natural,
sensuous, the feelings and so forth have <i>in themselves</i>
proportion, purpose, and agreement; while perception
and feeling are exalted into spiritual universality, and
thought itself, not content with renouncing its hostility
to nature, finds cheerfulness therein. Thus feeling,
pleasure, and enjoyment are justified and sanctified,
so that nature and freedom, sensuousness and the
idea, find their warrant and their satisfaction all in
<i>one</i>. Yet even this apparently complete reconciliation
is ultimately inferred<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to be, nevertheless, merely
subjective in respect of our appreciation as in respect
of our production, and not to be the naturally and
completely true and real.</p>

<p>These we may take as the main results of the
Kantian Criticism, so far as they have interest for us
in our present inquiry. This criticism forms the
starting-point for the true conception of artistic
beauty. Yet this conception had to overcome the
Kantian defects before it could assert itself as
the higher grasp of the true unity of necessity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
freedom, of the particular and the universal, of the
sensuous and the rational.</p>

<p>2. And so it must be admitted that the artistic
sense of a profound, and, at the same time, philosophic
mind was beforehand with philosophy as such, in
demanding and enunciating the principle of totality
and reconciliation as against that abstract endlessness
of reflective thought, that duty for duty's sake, that
intelligence devoid of plastic shape, which apprehend
nature and reality, sensation and feeling as a mere
<i>limit</i>, and as an absolutely hostile element. For
<i>Schiller</i> must be credited with the great merit of
having broken through the Kantian subjectivity and
abstractness of thought, and having dared the attempt
to transcend these limits by intellectually grasping
the principles of unity and reconciliation as the truth,
and realizing them in art. Schiller, in his æsthetic
discussions, did not simply adhere to art and its
interest without concerning himself about its relation
to philosophy proper, but compared his interest in
artistic beauty with the principles of philosophy; and
it was only by starting from the latter, and by their
help that he penetrated the profounder nature and
notion of the beautiful. Thus we feel it to be a
feature in one period of his works that he has busied
himself with thought&mdash;more perhaps than was conducive
to their unsophisticated beauty as works of
art. The intentional character of abstract reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and even the interest of the philosophical idea are
noticeable in many of his poems. This has been
made a ground of censure against him, especially by
way of blaming and depreciating him in comparison
with Goethe's agreeable straightforwardness<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and
objectivity. But in this respect Schiller, as poet, did
but pay the debt of his time; and the reason lay in
a perplexity which turned out only to the honour
of that sublime soul and profound character, and to
the profit of science and cognition.</p>

<p>At the same epoch the same scientific stimulus
withdrew Goethe, too, from poetry, his proper sphere.
Yet just as Schiller immersed himself in the study of
the inner depths of the <i>mind</i>, so Goethe's idiosyncrasy
led him to the <i>physical</i> side of art, to external nature,
to animal and vegetable organisms, to crystals, to
cloud formation, and to colour. To such scientific
research Goethe brought the power of his great mind,
which in these regions put to rout<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the science of
mere understanding with its errors, just as Schiller,
on the other side, succeeded in asserting the idea of
the free totality of beauty against the understanding's
science of volition and thought. A whole set of
Schiller's productions is devoted to this insight of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
into the nature of art, especially the "Letters upon
Æsthetic Education." In these letters the central
point from which Schiller starts is that every individual
human being has within him the capacity of
an ideal humanity. This genuine human being, he
says, is represented by the State,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> which he takes to
be the objective, universal, or, so to speak, normal form
in which the diversity of particular subjects or persons
aims at aggregating and combining itself into a unity.
There were, then, he considered, two imaginable ways
in which the human being in time (in the actual
course of events) might coincide with the human
being in the Idea: on the one hand, by the State, <i>qua</i>
genus or class-idea of morality,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> law, and intelligence,
destroying individuality; on the other hand, by the
individual raising himself to the level of his genus,
<i>i.e.</i> by the human being that lives in time ennobling
himself into the human being of the Idea. Now
reason, he thinks, demands unity as such, the generic
character, but nature demands diversity and individuality;
and both these legislative authorities have
simultaneous claims on man. In presence of the
conflict between these antagonistic elements, æsthetic
education simply consists in realizing the requirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of mediation and reconciliation between them. For the
aim of this education is, according to Schiller, to give
such form to inclination, sensuousness, impulse, and
heart, that they may become rational in themselves,
and by the same process reason, freedom, and
spirituality may come forward out of their abstraction,
and uniting with the natural element, now
rationalized throughout, may in it be invested with
flesh and blood. Beauty is thus pronounced to be
the unification of the rational and the sensuous, and
this unification to be the genuinely real.</p>

<p>This notion of Schiller's may be readily recognized
in the general views of "Anmuth und Würde,"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and in
his poems more particularly from the fact that he makes
the praise of women his subject matter; because it was
in their character that he recognized and held up to
notice the spontaneously present combination of the
spiritual and natural.</p>

<p>Now this <i>Unity</i> of the universal and particular, of
freedom and necessity, of the spiritual and the natural,
which Schiller grasped from a scientific point of view
as the principle and essence of art, and laboured
indefatigably to evoke into actual existence by help
of art and æsthetic culture, was considered, by a further
advance, <i>as the Idea itself</i>, and was thus constituted
the principle of knowledge and of existence, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Idea in this sense was recognized as the sole truth
and reality. By means of this recognition, science, in
Schelling's philosophy, attained its absolute standpoint,
and although art had previously begun to assert its
peculiar nature and dignity in relation to the highest
interests of humanity, yet it was now that the actual
<i>notion</i> of art and its place in scientific theory were
discovered. Art was now accepted, even if erroneously
in one respect, which this is not the place to discuss,
yet in its higher and genuine vocation. No doubt
before this time so early a writer as Winckelmann
had been inspired by his observation of the ideals
of the ancients in a way that led him to develop
a new sense for the contemplation of art, to rescue
it from the notions of commonplace aims and of
mere mimicry of nature, and to exert an immense
influence in favour of searching out the idea of art in
the works of art and in its history. For Winckelmann
should be regarded as one of the men who have succeeded
in furnishing the mind with a new organ and
new methods of study in the field of art. On the
theory, however, and the scientific knowledge of art
his view has had less influence.</p>

<p>3. To touch briefly on the further course of the
subject, A. W. and Friedrich von Schlegel, in
proximity to the renaissance of philosophy, being
covetous of novelty and with a thirst for what was
striking and extraordinary, appropriated as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of the philosophical idea as their natures, which were
anything but philosophical, and essentially of the
critical stamp, were capable of absorbing. Neither
of them can claim the reputation of a speculative
thinker. But it was they who, armed with their
critical understanding, set themselves somewhere
near the standpoint of the Idea, and with great
plainness of speech and audacity of innovation,
though with but a poor admixture of philosophy,
directed a clever polemic against the traditional views.
And thus they undoubtedly introduced in several
branches of art a new standard of judgment in conformity
with notions which were higher than those
that they attacked. As, however, their criticism was
not accompanied by the thorough philosophical comprehension
of their standard, this standard retained
a character of indefiniteness and vacillation, with the
result that they sometimes did too much and sometimes
too little. No doubt they are to be credited
with the merit of bringing afresh to light and extolling
in a loving spirit much that was held obsolete and
was inadequately esteemed by their age, e.g. the
work of the older painters of Italy and the Netherlands,
the "Nibelungen Lied," etc.; and, again, they
endeavoured with zeal to learn and to teach subjects
that were little known, such as the Indian poetry and
mythology. Nevertheless, they attributed too high
a value to the productions of such epochs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
sometimes themselves fell into the blunder of admiring
what was but mediocre, <i>e.g.</i> Holberg's comedies, and
attaching a universal importance to what had only
relative value, or even boldly showing themselves
enthusiasts for a perverse tendency and subordinate
standpoint as if it were something supreme.</p>

<p>Out of this tendency, and especially out of the
sentiments<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and doctrines of Fried. von Schlegel, there
further grew in all its manifold shapes the so-called
<i>Irony</i>. This idea had its deeper root, if we take it
in one of its aspects, in Fichte's philosophy, in so
far as the principles of his philosophy were applied
to art. Fried. von Schlegel, as also Schelling, started
from Fichte's point of view; Schelling, to pass wholly
beyond it, Fried. von Schlegel to develop it in a
peculiar fashion, and to tear himself loose from it.
As regards the intimate connection of Fichte's principles
with one tendency (among others) of the irony,
we need only lay stress on the following point, that
Fichte establishes the <b>I</b> as the absolute principle of
all knowledge, of all reason and cognition; and that
in the sense of the <b>I</b> which is, and is no more than,
utterly abstract and formal. For this reason, in the
second place, this <b>I</b> is in itself absolutely simple, and,
on the one hand, every characteristic, every attribute,
every content is negated therein&mdash;for every positive
matter is annihilated by absorption into this abstract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
freedom and unity; on the other side, every content
which is to be of value for the <b>I</b>, is given position and
recognition only by favour of the <b>I</b>. Whatever is,
is only by favour of the <b>I</b>,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and what is by my favour
<b>I</b> am in turn able to annihilate.</p>

<p>Now, if we abide by these utterly empty forms
which have their origin in the absoluteness of the
abstract <b>I</b>, then nothing has value in its real and
actual nature, and regarded<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> in itself, but only as
produced by the subjectivity of the <b>I</b>. But if so, it
follows that the <b>I</b> is able to remain lord and master
of everything, and in no sphere of morality or legality,
of things human or divine, profane or sacred, is there
anything that would not have to begin by being given
position by the <b>I</b>, and that might not, therefore, just
as well be in turn annihilated thereby. This amounts
to making all that is actual in its own right<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> a mere
<i>semblance</i>, not true and real for its own sake and by
its own means, but a mere appearance due to the
<b>I</b>, within whose power and caprice it remains, and
at its free disposal. To admit it or to annihilate it
stands purely in the pleasure of the <b>I</b> which has
attained absoluteness in itself and simply as <b>I</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>In the third place,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> then, the <b>I</b> is a <i>living</i>, active
individual, and its life consists in bringing its individuality
to its own consciousness as to that of others,
in uttering itself and taking shape in phenomena.
For every human being while he lives, seeks to realize
himself, and does realize himself. With respect to
beauty and art this receives the meaning of living as
artist and forming one's life <i>artistically</i>. But, according
to the principle before us, <b>I</b> live as artist when all
my action and utterance in general, whenever it has
to do with any content, is for me on the level of mere
<i>semblance</i>, and assumes a shape which is wholly in my
power. So <b>I</b> am not really in <i>earnest</i>, either about
this content, or generally, about its utterance and
realization. For genuine earnest comes into being
only by means of a substantial interest, a matter that
has something in it, truth, morality, and so forth; by
means of a content which, as such (without my help)
is enough to have value for me as something essential,
so that <b>I</b> myself only become essential in my own
eyes in as far as <b>I</b> have immersed myself in such a
matter and have come to be in conformity with it in
my whole knowledge and action. At the standpoint
according to which the artist is the <b>I</b> that binds and
looses<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> of its own power, for whom no content of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
consciousness counts as absolute and as essentially
real, but only as itself an artificial and dissoluble
semblance, such earnest can never come into being,
as nothing has validity ascribed to it but the formalism
of the <b>I</b>. By others, indeed, my self-display in which
<b>I</b> present myself to them may be taken seriously, inasmuch
as they interpret me as though I were really
concerned about the matter in hand; but therein they
are simply deceived, poor <i>borné</i> creatures, without
talent and capacity to apprehend and to attain my
standpoint. And this shows me that not every one is
so free (<i>formally</i><a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> free, that is) as to see in all that
usually has value, dignity, and sanctity for mankind,
simply a product of his own power of caprice, whereby
he is able to set his seal on the value of such
matters, and to determine himself and obtain a content
by their means, or not. And then this skill in
living an ironical artist life apprehends itself as a
<i>God-like geniality</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> for which every possible thing is a
mere dead creature, to which the free creator, knowing
himself to be wholly unattached, feels in no way
bound, seeing that he can annihilate as well as create
it. He who has attained such a standpoint of God-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
geniality looks down in superiority on all mankind
besides, for they are pronounced <i>borné</i> and dull in
as far as law, morality, and so forth retain for them
their fixed, obligatory, and essential validity. And
the individual who thus lives his artist life assigns
himself indeed relation to others, lives with friends,
mistresses, etc., but as genius he sets no value on
this relation to his determinate reality and particular
actions, or to what is universal in its
own right; that is, he assumes an ironical attitude
towards it.</p>

<p>This is the universal import of the genial God-like
irony, as that concentration of the <b>I</b> into itself for
which all bonds are broken, and which will only
endure to live in the bliss of self-enjoyment.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This
irony was the invention of Herr Fried. von Schlegel,
and many followed him in prating about it then, or
are prating of it afresh just now.</p>

<p>The proximate form of this negativity which displays
itself as irony is, then, on the one hand the
futility<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of all that is matter of fact, or moral and of
substantive import in itself; the nothingness of all
that is objective, and that has essential and actual
value. If the <b>I</b> remains at this point of view, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
appears to it as nothing worth and as futile, excepting
its own subjectivity, which thereby becomes hollow
and empty, and itself mere conceit.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> But on the
other hand, the reverse may happen, and the I may
also find itself unsatisfied in its enjoyment of itself,
and may prove insufficient to itself, so as in consequence
to feel a craving for the solid and substantial, for
determinate and essential interests. Out of this there
arises misfortune and antinomy, in that the subject
desires to penetrate into truth and has a craving for
objectivity, but yet is unable to abandon its isolation
and retirement into itself, and to strip itself free of
this unsatisfied abstract inwardness (of mind), and so
has a seizure of sickly yearning<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which we have also
seen emanate from Fichte's school. The discontent
of this quiescence and feebleness,&mdash;which does
not like to act or to touch anything for fear of
surrendering its inward harmony, and, for all its
craving after the absolute, remains none the less
unreal and empty, even though pure in itself,&mdash;is the
source of morbid saintliness[D] and yearning. For a
true saintly soul acts and is a reality. But all that
craving is the feeling of the nullity of the empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
futile<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> subject or person, which lacks the strength to
escape this its futility,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and to fill<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> itself with something
of substantial value.</p>

<p>In so far, however, as the Irony was treated as a
form of art, it did not content itself with conferring
artistic shape upon the life and particular individuality
of the artist. In addition to the works of art presented
by his own actions, etc., the artist was bound
to produce external works of art as creations of his
fancy. The principle of these productions, which for
the most part can only come to the birth in poetical
form, is, in due course, the representation of the
Divine as the Ironical. The ironical, as "genial"
individuality, consists in the self-annihilation of what
is noble, great, and excellent; and thus even the
objective shapes of art will have to represent the mere
principle of absolute subjectivity, by displaying what
has value and nobleness for man as null in its self-annihilation.
This implies, not merely that we are
not to be serious about the right, the moral, and the
true, but that the highest and best of all has nothing
in it, inasmuch as in its exhibition through individuals,
characters, and actions, it refutes and annihilates
itself, and so is irony at its own expense. This mode,
taken in the abstract, borders closely on the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of comedy; but yet within this affinity the comic
must be essentially distinguished from the ironical.
For the comic must be limited to bringing to nothing
what is in itself null, a false and self-contradictory
phenomenon; for instance, a whim, a perversity, or
particular caprice, set over against a mighty passion;
or even a <i>supposed</i> reliable principle or rigid maxim
may be shown to be null. But it is quite another
thing when what is in reality moral and true, any
substantial content as such, exhibits itself as null in
an individual and by his means. Such an individual
is then null and despicable in character, and weakness
and want of character are thus introduced into the
representation. In this distinction between the ironical
and the comic it is therefore an essential question
what import that has which is brought to nothing.
In the case supposed they are wretched worthless
subjects, persons destitute of the power to abide by
their fixed and essential purpose, but ready to
surrender it and let it be destroyed in them. The
"Irony" loves this irony of the characterless. For true
character involves on the one hand an essential import
in its purpose; on the other hand, adherence to that
purpose, such that the individuality would be robbed
of its whole existence if forced to desist from and to
abandon it. This stability and substance constitute
the keynote of character. <i>Cato</i> can live only as
Roman and as republican. Now, if Irony is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
as the keynote of the representation, this means that
the supremely inartistic is taken as the true principle
of the work of art. For the result is in part insipid
figures; in part shapes void of import and of conduct,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
seeing that their substantive nature turns out to be
a nullity; and in part, finally, those yearning moods
and unresolved contradictions of the heart that attach
themselves to such conceptions. Representations of
this kind can awake no genuine interest. And for
this reason it is from the Irony that we have eternal
lamentations over the lack of profound feeling, artistic
insight, and genius in the public, inasmuch as it does
not understand these heights of Irony. That is to
say, the public does not like all this mediocrity, half
grotesque and half characterless. And it is well that
these unsubstantial languishing natures afford no
pleasure; it is a comfort that such insincerity and
hypocrisy are not approved, and that, on the contrary,
man has a desire no less for full and genuine interests
than for characters which remain true to the weighty
purposes of their lives.</p>

<p>It may be added as an historical remark that those
who more particularly adopted irony as the supreme
principle of art were Solger and Ludwig Tieck.</p>

<p>This is not the place to speak of Solger at the
length which is due to him, and I must content myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with a few observations. Solger was not like the
others, satisfied with superficial philosophical culture,
but the genuine speculative need of his innermost
nature impelled him to descend into the depths of the
philosophic idea. And therein he hit upon the dialectical
element of the Idea, the point to which I give
the name of "infinite absolute negativity," the activity
of the idea in that it negates itself as the infinite and
universal, so as to become finiteness and particularity,
and just as really cancels this negation in turn,
establishing thereby the universal and infinite in the
finite and particular. Solger got no further than this
negativity, and it is no doubt an element in the
speculative idea, but yet when conceived as this mere
dialectic unrest and dissolution both of infinite and of
finite <i>no more than</i> an element; not, as Solger maintains,
<i>the entire Idea</i>. Unhappily Solger's life was too
soon interrupted for him to have achieved the concrete
development of the philosophical Idea. And so he
never got beyond this aspect of negativity, which has
affinity with the dissolution that Irony effects of what
is determinate and of what has substantive value in
itself, a negativity in which he saw the principle of
artistic activity. Yet in his actual life, considering
the solidity, seriousness, and strength of his character,
he neither was himself, in the sense above depicted,
an ironical artist, nor was his profound feeling for
genuine works of art, developed in protracted art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
studies, in this respect of an ironical nature. So much
in vindication of Solger, whose life, philosophy, and
art merit to be distinguished from the previously
mentioned apostles of irony.</p>

<p>As regards Ludwig Tieck, his culture, too, dates
from that period in which for some time Jena was the
literary centre.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Tieck and others of these distinguished
people display great familiarity with the
phrases in question, but without telling us what they
mean by them. Thus, Tieck no doubt always says
there ought to be Irony; but when he himself approaches
the criticism of great works of art, though
his recognition and portrayal of their greatness is
excellent, yet, if we fancy that now is the best opportunity
to explain where the Irony is, <i>e.g.</i> in such a
work as "Romeo and Juliet," we are taken in&mdash;for
we hear no more about the Irony.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT.</p>


<p>1. After the above introductory remarks, it is now
time to pass to the study of our object-matter. But
we are still in the introduction, and an introduction
cannot do more than lay down, for the sake of explanation,
the general sketch of the entire course
which will be followed by our subsequent scientific
considerations. As, however, we have spoken of art
as proceeding from the absolute Idea, and have
even assigned as its end the sensuous representation
of the absolute itself, we shall have to conduct this
review in a way to show, at least in general, how the
particular divisions of the subject spring from the
conception of artistic beauty as the representation of
the absolute. Therefore we must attempt to awaken
a very general idea of this conception itself.</p>

<p>It has already been said that the content of art
is the Idea, and that its form lies in the plastic use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
images accessible to sense. These two sides art has
to reconcile into a full and united totality. The <i>first</i>
attribution which this involves is the requirement
that the content, which is to be offered to artistic
representation, shall show itself to be in its nature
worthy of such representation. Otherwise we only
obtain a bad combination, whereby a content that
will not submit to plasticity and to external presentation,
is forced into that form, and a matter which is
in its nature prosaic is expected to find an appropriate
mode of manifestation in the form antagonistic to its
nature.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> requirement, which is derivable from
this first, demands of the content of art that it should
not be anything abstract in itself. This does not
mean that it must be concrete as the sensuous is
concrete in contrast to everything spiritual and intellectual,
these being taken as in themselves simple
and abstract. For everything that has genuine truth
in the mind as well as in nature is concrete in itself,
and has, in spite of its universality, nevertheless, both
subjectivity and particularity within it. If we say,
<i>e.g.</i>, of God that he is simply <i>One</i>, the supreme Being
as such, we have only enunciated a lifeless abstraction
of the irrational understanding. Such a God, as he
himself is not apprehended in his concrete truth, can
afford no material for art, least of all for plastic art.
Hence the Jews and the Turks have not been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
represent their God, who does not even amount to
such an abstraction of the understanding, in the
positive way in which Christians have done so. For
God in Christianity is conceived in His truth, and
therefore, as in Himself thoroughly concrete, as a
person, as a subject,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and more closely determined, as
mind or spirit. What He is as spirit unfolds itself to
the religious apprehension as the Trinity of Persons,
which at the same time in relation with itself is <i>One</i>.
Here is essentiality, universality, and particularity,
together with their reconciled unity; and it is only
such unity that constitutes the concrete. Now, as
a content in order to possess truth at all must be of
this concrete nature, art demands the same concreteness,
because a mere abstract universal has not in
itself the vocation to advance to particularity and
phenomenal manifestation and to unity with itself
therein.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>If a true and therefore concrete content is to have
corresponding to it a sensuous form and modelling,
this sensuous form must, in the third place, be no less
emphatically something individual, wholly concrete in
itself, and one. The character of concreteness as
belonging to both elements of art, to the content as
to the representation, is precisely the point in which
both may coincide and correspond to one another;
as, for instance, the natural shape of the human body
is such a sensuous concrete as is capable of representing
spirit, which is concrete in itself, and of displaying
itself in conformity therewith. Therefore we ought
to abandon the idea that it is a mere matter of
accident that an actual phenomenon of the external
world is chosen to furnish a shape thus conformable
to truth. Art does not appropriate this form either
because it simply finds it existing or because there is
no other. The concrete content itself involves the
element of external and actual, we may say indeed of
sensible manifestation. But in compensation this
sensuous concrete, in which a content essentially
belonging to mind expresses itself, is in its own
nature addressed to the inward being; its external
element of shape, whereby the content is made
perceptible and imaginable, has the aim of existing
purely for the heart and mind. This is the only
reason for which content and artistic shape are
fashioned in conformity with each other. The <i>mere</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
sensuous concrete, external nature as such, has not
this purpose for its exclusive ground of origin. The
birds' variegated plumage shines unseen, and their
song dies away unheard, the <i>Cereus</i><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> which blossoms
only for a night withers without having been admired
in the wilds of southern forests, and these forests,
jungles of the most beautiful and luxuriant vegetation,
with the most odorous and aromatic perfumes,
perish and decay no less unenjoyed. The work of
art has not such a naïve self-centred being, but is
essentially a question, an address to the responsive
heart, an appeal to affections and to minds.</p>

<p>Although the artistic bestowal of sensuous form
is in this respect not accidental, yet on the other
hand it is not the highest mode of apprehending the
spiritually concrete. Thought is a higher mode than
representation by means of the sensuous concrete.
Although in a relative sense abstract, yet it must not
be one-sided but concrete thinking, in order to be true
and rational. Whether a given content has sensuous
artistic representation for its adequate form, or in
virtue of its nature essentially demands a higher and
more spiritual embodiment, is a distinction that displays
itself at once, if, for instance, we compare the
Greek gods with God as conceived according to
Christian ideas. The Greek god is not abstract but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
individual, and is closely akin to the natural human
shape; the Christian God is equally a concrete personality,
but in the mode of pure spiritual existence,
and is to be known as <i>mind</i><a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and in mind. His
medium of existence is therefore essentially inward
knowledge and not external natural form, by means
of which He can only be represented imperfectly, and
not in the whole depth of His idea.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as the task of art is to represent the
idea to direct perception in sensuous shape, and not
in the form of thought or of pure spirituality as such,
and seeing that this work of representation has its
value and dignity in the correspondence and the unity
of the two sides, <i>i.e.</i> of the Idea and its plastic embodiment,
it follows that the level and excellency of
art in attaining a realization adequate to its idea,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
must depend upon the grade of inwardness and unity
with which Idea and Shape display themselves as
fused into one.</p>

<p>Thus the higher truth is spiritual being that has
attained a shape adequate to the conception of spirit.
This is what furnishes the principle of division for the
science of art. For before the mind can attain the
true notion of its absolute essence, it has to traverse
a course of stages whose ground is in this idea itself;
and to this evolution of the content with which it
supplies itself, there corresponds an evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
immediately connected therewith, of the plastic forms of
art, under the shape of which the mind as artist
presents to itself the consciousness of itself.</p>

<p>This evolution within the art-spirit has again in
its own nature two sides. In the <i>first</i> place the development
itself is a spiritual<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and universal one, in
so far as the graduated series of definite <i>conceptions of
the world</i> as the definite but comprehensive consciousness
of nature, man and God, gives itself artistic
shape; and, in the <i>second</i> place, this <i>universal</i> development
of art is obliged to provide itself with
external existence and sensuous form, and the definite
modes of the sensuous art-existence are themselves a
totality of necessary distinctions in the realm of art&mdash;which
are <i>the several arts</i>. It is true, indeed, that the
necessary kinds of artistic representation are on the
one hand <i>qua</i> spiritual of a very general nature, and
not restricted to any one material;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> while sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
existence contains manifold varieties of matter. But
as this latter, like the mind, has the Idea potentially
for its inner soul, it follows from this that particular
sensuous materials have a close affinity and secret
accord with the spiritual distinctions and types of art
presentation.</p>

<p>In its completeness, however, our science divides
itself into three principal portions.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, we obtain a <i>general part</i>. It has for its content
and object the universal Idea of artistic beauty&mdash;this
beauty being conceived as the Ideal&mdash;together
with the nearer relation of the latter both to nature
and to subjective artistic production.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, there develops itself out of the idea of
artistic beauty a <i>particular</i> part, in as far as the essential
differences which this idea contains in itself evolve
themselves into a scale <i>particular</i> plastic<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> forms.</p>

<p>In the <i>third</i> place there results a <i>final</i> part, which
has for its subject the individualization of artistic
beauty, that consists in the advance of art to the
sensuous realization of its shapes and its self-completion
as a system of the several arts<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and their genera
and species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>2. With respect to the first part, we must begin
by recalling to mind, in order to make the sequel
intelligible, that the Idea <i>qua</i> the beautiful in art is
not the Idea as such, in the mode in which a metaphysical
logic apprehends it as the absolute, but the
Idea as developed into concrete form fit for reality,
and as having entered into immediate and adequate
unity with this reality. For the <i>Idea as such</i>, although
it is the essentially and actually true, is yet the truth
only in its generality which has not yet taken objective
shape; but the <i>Idea</i> as the <i>beautiful in art</i> is
at once the Idea when specially determined as in its
essence individual reality, and also an individual
shape of reality essentially destined to embody and
reveal the Idea. This amounts to enunciating the
requirement that the Idea, and its plastic mould as
concrete reality, are to be made completely adequate
to one another. When reduced to such form the
Idea, as a reality moulded in conformity with the
conception of the Idea, is the <i>Ideal</i>. The problem
of this conformity might, to begin with, be understood
in the sense that any Idea would serve, so
long as the actual shape, it did not matter what
shape, represented this particular Idea and no other.
But if so, the required truth of the Ideal is confounded
with mere correctness, which consists in the expression
of any meaning whatever in appropriate fashion so
that its import may be readily recognized in the shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
created. The Ideal is not to be thus understood.
Any content whatever may attain to being represented
quite adequately, judged by the standard of
its own nature, but it does not therefore gain the right
to claim the artistic beauty of the Ideal. Compared
indeed with ideal beauty, even the presentation will
in such a case appear defective. From this point of
view we must remark to begin with, what cannot be
proved till later, that the defects of a work of art are
not to be regarded simply as always due, for instance,
to individual unskillfulness. <i>Defectiveness of form</i>
arises from <i>defectiveness of content</i>. So, for example,
the Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians in their artistic
shapes, their forms of deities, and their idols, never
got beyond a formless phase, or one of a vicious and
false definiteness of form, and were unable to attain
genuine beauty; because their mythological ideas, the
content and thought of their works of art, were as
yet indeterminate in themselves, or of a vicious determinateness,
and did not consist in the content that is
absolute in itself. The more that works of art excel
in true beauty of presentation, the more profound is
the inner truth of their content and thought. And in
dealing with this point, we have not to think merely
perhaps of the greater or lesser skill with which the
natural forms as given in external reality are apprehended
and imitated. For in certain stages of art-consciousness
and of representation, the distortion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and disfigurement of natural structures is not unintentional
technical inexpertness and want of skill, but
intentional alteration, which emanates from the content
that is in consciousness, and is required thereby.
Thus, from this point of view, there is such a thing as
imperfect art, which may be quite perfect, both technically
and in other respects, <i>in its determinate</i> sphere,
yet reveals itself to be defective when compared with
the conception of art as such, and with the Ideal.
Only in the highest art are the Idea and the representation
genuinely adequate to one another, in the
sense that the outward shape given to the Idea is in
itself essentially and actually the true shape, because
the content of the Idea, which that shape expresses,
is itself the true and real content. It is a corollary
from this, as we indicated above,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> that the Idea must
be defined in and through itself as concrete totality,
and thereby possess in itself the principle and standard
of its particularization and determination in external
appearance. For example, the Christian imagination
will be able to represent God only in human form
and with man's intellectual expression, because it
is herein that God Himself is completely known in
Himself as mind. Determinateness is, as it were, the
bridge to phenomenal existence. Where this determinateness
is not totality derived from the Idea itself,
where the Idea is not conceived as self-determining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and self-particularizing, the Idea remains abstract and
has its determinateness, and therefore the principle
that dictates its particular and exclusively appropriate
mode of presentation, not in itself but external to it.
Therefore, the Idea when still abstract has even its
shape external, and not dictated by itself. The Idea,
however, which is concrete in itself bears the principle
of its mode of manifestation within itself, and is by
that means the free process of giving shape to itself.
Thus it is only the truly concrete Idea that can
generate the true shape, and this correspondence of
the two is the Ideal.</p>

<p>3. Now because the Idea is in this fashion concrete
unity, it follows that this unity can enter into the art-consciousness
only by the expansion and reconciliation
of the particularities of the Idea, and it is through
this evolution that artistic beauty comes to possess
a <i>totality of particular stages and forms</i>. Therefore,
after we have studied the beauty of art in itself and
on its own merits, we must see how beauty as a whole
breaks up into its particular determinations. This
gives, as our <i>second part</i>, <i>the doctrine of the types of art</i>.
These forms find their genesis in the different modes
of grasping the Idea as artistic content, whereby is
conditioned a difference of the form in which it manifests
itself. Hence the types of art are nothing but
the different relations of content and shape, relations
which emanate from the Idea itself, and furnish thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the true basis of division for this sphere. For the principle
of division must always be contained in <i>that</i> conception
whose particularization and division is in question.</p>

<p>We have here to consider <i>three</i> relations of the
Idea to its outward shaping.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>&alpha;. First, the Idea gives rise to the beginning of
Art when, being itself still in its indistinctness and
obscurity, or in vicious untrue determinateness, it is
made the import of artistic creations. As indeterminate
it does not yet possess in itself that individuality
which the Ideal demands; its abstractness and
one-sidedness leave its shape to be outwardly bizarre
and defective. The first form of art is therefore
rather a mere search after plastic portrayal than a
capacity of genuine representation. The Idea has not
yet found the true form even within itself, and therefore
continues to be merely the struggle and aspiration
thereafter. In general terms we may call this form
the <i>Symbolic</i> form of art. In it the abstract Idea
has its outward shape external to itself<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> in natural
sensuous matter, with which the process of shaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
begins, and from which, <i>qua</i> outward expression, it is
inseparable.</p>

<p>Natural objects are thus primarily left unaltered,
and yet at the same time invested with the substantial
Idea as their significance, so that they receive the
vocation of expressing it, and claim to be interpreted
as though the Idea itself were present in them. At
the root of this is the fact that natural objects have in
them an aspect in which they are capable of representing
a universal meaning. But as an adequate
correspondence is not yet possible, this reference can
only concern <i>an abstract attribute</i>, as when a lion is
used to mean strength.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this abstractness of the relation
brings to consciousness no less strongly the foreignness
of the Idea to natural phenomena; and the Idea,
having no other reality to express it, expatiates in all
these shapes, seeks itself in them in all their unrest
and disproportion, but nevertheless does not find them
adequate to itself. Then it proceeds to exaggerate
the natural shapes and the phenomena of reality into
indefiniteness and disproportion, to intoxicate itself in
them, to seethe and ferment in them, to do violence to
them, to distort and explode them into unnatural
shapes, and strives by the variety, hugeness, and splendour
of the forms employed<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> to exalt the phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to the level of the Idea. For the Idea is here still more
or less indeterminate and non-plastic, but the natural
objects are in their shape thoroughly determinate.</p>

<p>Hence, in view of the unsuitability of the two
elements to each other, the relation of the Idea
to objective reality becomes a <i>negative</i> one, for the
former, as in its nature inward,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> is unsatisfied with
such an externality, and as being its inner universal
substance<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> persists in exaltation or <i>Sublimity</i> beyond
and above all this inadequate abundance of shapes.
In virtue of this sublimity the natural phenomena and
the human shapes and incidents are accepted, and left
as they were, though at the same time understood to
be inadequate to their significance, which is exalted
far above every earthly content.</p>

<p>These aspects may be pronounced in general terms
to constitute the character of the primitive artistic
pantheism of the East, which either charges even the
meanest objects with the absolute import, or again
coerces nature with violence into the expression of its
view. By this means it becomes bizarre, grotesque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and tasteless, or turns the infinite but abstract freedom
of the substantive Idea disdainfully against all phenomenal
being as null and evanescent. By such means
the import cannot be completely embodied in the
expression, and in spite of all aspiration and endeavour
the reciprocal inadequacy of shape and Idea remains
insuperable. This may be taken as the first form of
art,&mdash;Symbolic art with its aspiration, its disquiet,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> its
mystery and its sublimity.</p>

<p>(&beta;) In the second form of art, which we propose
to call "<i>Classical</i>," the double defect of symbolic art
is cancelled. The plastic shape of symbolic art is
imperfect, because, in the first place, the Idea in it only
enters into consciousness in <i>abstract</i> determinateness
or indeterminateness, and, in the second place, this
must always make the conformity of shape to import
defective, and in its turn merely abstract. The classical
form of art is the solution of this double difficulty; it
is the free and adequate embodiment of the Idea in
the shape that, according to its conception, is peculiarly
appropriate to the Idea itself. With it, therefore,
the Idea is capable of entering into free and complete
accord. Hence, the classical type of art is the first to
afford the production and intuition of the completed
Ideal, and to establish it as a realized fact.</p>

<p>The conformity, however, of notion and reality in
classical art must not be taken in the purely <i>formal</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
sense of the agreement of a content with the external
shape given to it, any more than this could be the
case with the Ideal itself. Otherwise every copy from
nature, and every type of countenance, every landscape,
flower, or scene, etc., which forms the purport
of any representation, would be at once made classical
by the agreement which it displays between form and
content. On the contrary, in classical art the peculiarity
of the content consists in being itself concrete
idea, and, as such, the concrete spiritual; for only the
spiritual is the truly inner self. To suit such a content,
then, we must search out that in Nature which
on its own merits belongs to the essence and actuality
of the mind. It must be the absolute<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> notion that
<i>invented</i> the shape appropriate to concrete mind,
so that the <i>subjective</i> notion&mdash;in this case the spirit
of art&mdash;has merely <i>found</i> it, and brought it, as an
existence possessing natural shape, into accord
with free individual spirituality.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> This shape, with
which the Idea as spiritual&mdash;as individually determinate
spirituality&mdash;invests itself when manifested
as a temporal phenomenon, is <i>the human form</i>. Personification
and anthropomorphism have often been
decried as a degradation of the spiritual; but art, in as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
far as its end is to bring before perception the spiritual
in sensuous form, must advance to such anthropomorphism,
as it is only in its proper body that
mind is adequately revealed to sense. The migration
of souls is in this respect a false abstraction,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and
physiology ought to have made it one of its axioms
that life had necessarily in its evolution to attain to
the human shape, as the sole sensuous phenomenon
that is appropriate to mind. The human form is
employed in the classical type of art not as mere
sensuous existence, but exclusively as the existence
and physical form corresponding to mind, and is
therefore exempt from all the deficiencies of what is
merely sensuous, and from the contingent finiteness
of phenomenal existence. The outer shape must be
thus purified in order to express in itself a content
adequate to itself; and again, if the conformity of
import and content is to be complete, the spiritual
meaning which is the content must be of a particular
kind. It must, that is to say, be qualified to express
itself completely in the physical form of man, without
projecting into another world beyond the scope of
such an expression in sensuous and bodily terms.
This condition has the effect that Mind is by it at
once specified as a particular case of mind, as human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mind, and not as simply absolute and eternal, inasmuch
as mind in this latter sense is incapable of
proclaiming and expressing itself otherwise than as
intellectual being.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Out of this latter point arises, in its turn, the
defect which brings about the dissolution of classical
art, and demands a transition into a third and higher
form, viz. into the <i>romantic</i> form of art.</p>

<p>(&gamma;) The romantic form of art destroys the completed
union of the Idea and its reality, and recurs,
though in a higher phase, to that difference and
antagonism of two aspects which was left unvanquished
by symbolic art. The classical type attained
the highest excellence, of which the sensuous embodiment
of art is capable; and if it is in any way
defective, the defect is in art as a whole, <i>i.e.</i> in the
limitation of its sphere. This limitation consists in
the fact that art as such takes for its object Mind&mdash;the
conception of which is <i>infinite</i> concrete universality&mdash;in
the shape of <i>sensuous</i> concreteness, and in the
classical phase sets up the perfect amalgamation of
spiritual and sensuous existence as a Conformity of
the two. Now, as a matter of fact, in such an amalgamation
Mind cannot be represented according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
its true notion. For mind is the infinite subjectivity
of the Idea, which, as absolute inwardness,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is not
capable of finding free expansion in its true nature
on condition of remaining transposed into a bodily
medium as the existence appropriate to it.</p>

<p>As <i>an escape from such a condition</i> the romantic
form of art in its turn dissolves the inseparable unity
of the classical phase, because it has won a significance
which goes beyond the classical form of art and
its mode of expression.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This significance&mdash;if we may
recall familiar ideas&mdash;coincides with what Christianity
declares to be true of God as Spirit, in contradistinction
to the Greek faith in gods which forms the
essential and appropriate content for classical art. In
Greek art the concrete import is potentially, but not
explicitly, the unity of the human and divine nature;
a unity which, just because it is purely <i>immediate</i><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
and <i>not explicit</i>, is capable of adequate manifestation
in an immediate and sensuous mode. The Greek
god is the object of naive intuition and sensuous
imagination. His shape is, therefore, the bodily shape
of man. The circle of his power and of his being is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
individual and individually limited. In relation with
the subject,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> he is, therefore, an essence and a power
with which the subject's inner being is merely in
latent unity, not itself possessing this unity as inward
subjective knowledge. Now the higher stage is the
<i>knowledge</i> of this <i>latent</i> unity, which as latent is the
import of the classical form of art, and capable of
perfect representation in bodily shape. The elevation
of the latent or potential into self-conscious
knowledge produces an enormous difference. It is
the infinite difference which, <i>e.g.</i>, separates man as
such from the animals. Man is animal, but even in
his animal functions he is not confined within the
latent and potential as the animal is, but becomes
conscious of them, learns to know them, and raises
them&mdash;as, for instance, the process of digestion&mdash;into
self-conscious science. By this means Man breaks
the boundary of merely potential and immediate consciousness,
so that just for the reason that he knows
himself to be animal, he ceases to be animal, and, as
<i>mind</i>, attains to self-knowledge.</p>

<p>If in the above fashion the unity of the human and
divine nature, which in the former phase was potential,
is raised from an <i>immediate</i> to a <i>conscious</i> unity, it
follows that the true medium for the reality of this
content is no longer the sensuous immediate existence
of the spiritual, the human bodily shape, but <i>self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
inward intelligence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Now, Christianity brings
God before our intelligence <i>as spirit</i>, or mind&mdash;not as
particularized individual spirit, but as absolute, in
<i>spirit</i> and in truth. And for this reason Christianity
retires from the sensuousness of imagination into intellectual
inwardness, and makes this, not bodily shape,
the medium and actual existence of its significance.
So, too, the unity of the human and divine nature is a
conscious unity, only to be realized by <i>spiritual</i> knowledge
and in <i>spirit</i>. Thus the new content, won by
this unity, is not inseparable from sensuous representation,
as if that were adequate to it, but is freed from
this immediate existence, which has to be posited<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
as negative, absorbed, and reflected into the spiritual
unity. In this way, romantic art must be considered
as art transcending itself, while remaining within the
artistic sphere and in artistic form.</p>

<p>Therefore, in short, we may abide by the statement
that in this third stage the object (of art) is
<i>free</i>, concrete intellectual being, which has the function
of revealing itself as spiritual existence for the inward<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
world of spirit. In conformity with such an object-matter,
art cannot work for sensuous perception. It
must address itself to the inward mind, which coalesces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
with its object simply and as though this were itself,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
to the subjective inwardness, to the heart, the feeling,
which, being spiritual, aspires to freedom within itself,
and seeks and finds its reconciliation only in the spirit
within. It is this <i>inner</i> world that forms the content
of the romantic, and must therefore find its representation
as such inward feeling, and in the show or
presentation of such feeling. The world of inwardness
celebrates its triumph over the outer world, and
actually in the sphere of the outer and in its medium
manifests this its victory, owing to which the sensuous
appearance sinks into worthlessness.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, this type of Art,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> like
every other, needs an external vehicle of expression.
Now the spiritual has withdrawn into itself out of the
external and its immediate oneness therewith. For
this reason, the sensuous externality of concrete form
is accepted and represented, as in Symbolic art, as
something transient and fugitive. And the same
measure is dealt to the subjective finite mind and
will, even including the peculiarity or caprice of
the individual, of character, action, etc., or of incident
and plot. The aspect of external existence
is committed to contingency, and left at the mercy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
freaks of imagination, whose caprice is no more likely
to mirror what is given <i>as</i> it is given, than to throw
the shapes of the outer world into chance medley, or
distort them into grotesqueness. For this external
element no longer has its notion and significance, as
in classical art, in its own sphere, and in its own
medium. It has come to find them in the feelings,
the display of which is <i>in themselves</i> instead of being
in the external and <i>its</i> form of reality, and which
have the power to preserve or to regain their state of
reconciliation with themselves, in every accident, in
every unessential circumstance that takes independent
shape, in all misfortune and grief, and even in crime.</p>

<p>Owing to this, the characteristics of symbolic art,
in difference, discrepancy, and severance of Idea and
plastic shape, are here reproduced, but with an essential
difference. In the sphere of the romantic, the Idea,
whose defectiveness in the case of the symbol produced
the defect of external shape, has to reveal itself
in the medium of spirit and feelings as perfected in
itself. And it is because of this higher perfection
that it withdraws itself from any adequate union with
the external element, inasmuch as it can seek and
achieve its true reality and revelation nowhere but in
itself.</p>

<p>This we may take as in the abstract the character
of the symbolic, classical, and romantic forms of art,
which represent the three relations of the Idea to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
embodiment in the sphere of art. They consist in
the aspiration after, and the attainment and transcendence
of the Ideal as the true Idea of beauty.</p>

<p>4. The third part of our subject, in contradistinction
to the two just described, presupposes the conception
of the Ideal, and the general types of art, inasmuch
as it simply consists of their realization in particular
sensuous media. Hence we have no longer to do
with the inner development of artistic beauty in conformity
with its general fundamental principles. What
we have to study is how these principles pass into
actual existence, how they distinguish themselves in
their external aspect, and how they give actuality to
every element contained in the idea of beauty, separately
and by itself <i>as a work of art</i>, and not merely
as a general type. Now, what art transfers into
external existence are the differences<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> proper to the
idea of beauty and immanent therein. Therefore, the
general types of art must reveal themselves in this
third part, as before, in the character of the fundamental
principle that determines the arrangement
and definition of the <i>several arts</i>; in other words,
the species of art contain in themselves the same
essential modifications as those with which we become
acquainted as the general types of art. External
objectivity, however, to which these forms are introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
through the medium of a sensuous and therefore
<i>particular</i> material, affects these types in the way of
making them <i>separate</i> into independent and so particular
forms embodying their realization. For each
type finds its definite character in some one definite
external material, and its adequate actuality in the
mode of portrayal which that prescribes. But, moreover,
these types of art, being for all their determinateness,
its <i>universal</i> forms, break the bounds of <i>particular</i>
realization by a determinate form of art, and achieve
existence in other arts as well, although in subordinate
fashion. Therefore, the particular arts belong
each of them specifically to <i>one</i> of the general types
of art, and constitute <i>its adequate</i> external actuality;
and also they represent, each of them after its own
mode of external plasticity, the totality of the types
of art.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Then, speaking generally, we are dealing in this
third principal division with the beautiful of art, as it
unfolds itself in the several arts and in their creations
into a <i>world</i> of actualized beauty. The content of
this world is the beautiful, and the true beautiful, as
we saw, is spiritual being in concrete shape, the Ideal;
or, more closely looked at, the absolute mind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the truth itself. This region, that of divine truth
artistically represented to perception and to feeling,
forms the centre of the whole world of art. It is the
independent, free, and divine plasticity, which has
thoroughly mastered the external elements of form
and of medium, and wears them simply as a means
to manifestation of itself. Still, as the beautiful unfolds
itself in this region in the character of <i>objective</i>
reality, and in so doing distinguishes within itself its
individual aspects and elements, permitting them independent
particularity, it follows that this centre
erects its extremes, realized in their peculiar actuality,
into its own antitheses. Thus one of these extremes
comes to consist in an objectivity as yet devoid of
mind, in the merely natural vesture of God. At this
point the external element takes plastic shape as
something that has its spiritual aim and content, not
in itself, but in another.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The other extreme is the divine as inward, as
something known, as the variously particularized
<i>subjective</i> existence of the Deity; it is the truth as
operative and vital in sense, heart, and mind of individual
subjects, not persisting in the mould of its
external shapes, but as having returned into subjective,
individual inwardness. In such a mode, the
Divine is at the same time distinguished from its first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
manifestation as Deity, and passes thereby into the
diversity of particulars which belongs to all subjective
knowledge&mdash;emotion, perception, and feeling. In the
analogous province of religion, with which art at its
highest stage is immediately connected, we conceive
this same difference as follows. <i>First</i>, we think of the
earthly natural life in its finiteness as standing on one
side; but, then, <i>secondly</i>, consciousness makes God its
object, in which the distinction of objectivity and
subjectivity is done away. And at last, <i>thirdly</i>, we
advance from God as such to the devotion of the
community, that is, to God as living and present in
the subjective consciousness. Just so these three
chief modifications present themselves in the world
of art in independent development.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) The <i>first</i> of the particular arts with which,
according to their fundamental principle, we have to
begin, is architecture considered as a fine art.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Its
task lies in so manipulating external inorganic nature
that it becomes cognate to mind, as an artistic outer
world. The material of architecture is matter itself
in its immediate externality as a heavy mass subject
to mechanical laws, and its forms do not depart from
the forms of inorganic nature, but are merely set in
order in conformity with relations of the abstract
understanding, <i>i.e.</i> with relations of symmetry. In
this material and in such forms, the ideal as concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
spirituality does not admit of being realized. Hence
the reality which is represented in them remains contrasted
with the Idea, as something external which it
has not penetrated, or has penetrated only to establish
an abstract relation. For these reasons, the fundamental
type of the fine art of building is the <i>symbolical</i>
form of art. It is architecture that pioneers the way
for the adequate realization of the God, and in this
its service bestows hard toil upon existing nature, in
order to disentangle it from the jungle of finitude
and the abortiveness of chance. By this means it
levels a space for the God, gives form to his external
surroundings, and builds him his temple as a fit place
for concentration of spirit, and for its direction to the
mind's absolute objects. It raises an enclosure round
the assembly of those gathered together, as a defence
against the threatening of the storm, against rain, the
hurricane, and wild beasts, and reveals the will to
assemble, although externally, yet in conformity with
principles of art. With such import as this it has
power to inspire its material and its forms more or
less effectively, as the determinate character of the
content on behalf of which it sets to work is more or
less significant, more concrete or more abstract, more
profound in sounding its own depths, or more dim
and more superficial. So much, indeed, may architecture
attempt in this respect as even to create an
adequate artistic existence for such an import in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
shapes and in its material. But in such a case it has
already overstepped its own boundary, and is leaning
to sculpture, the phase above it. For the limit of
architecture lies precisely in this point, that it retains
the spiritual as an inward existence over against the
external forms of the art, and consequently must refer
to what has soul only as to something other than its
own creations.</p>

<p>&beta; Architecture, however, as we have seen, has
purified the external world, and endowed it with
symmetrical order and with affinity to mind; and
the temple of the God, the house of his community,
stands ready. Into this temple, then, in the <i>second</i>
place, the God enters in the lightning-flash of individuality,
which strikes and permeates the inert mass,
while the infinite<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and no longer merely symmetrical
form belonging to mind itself concentrates and gives
shape to the corresponding bodily existence. This is
the task of <i>Sculpture</i>. In as far as in this art the
spiritual inward being which architecture can but
indicate makes itself at home in the sensuous shape
and its external matter, and in as far as these two
sides are so adapted to one another that neither is
predominant, sculpture must be assigned the <i>classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
form of art</i> as its fundamental type. For this reason
the sensuous element itself has here no expression
which could not be that of the spiritual element, just
as, conversely, sculpture can represent no spiritual
content which does not admit throughout of being
adequately presented to perception in bodily form.
Sculpture should place the spirit before us in its
bodily form and in immediate unity therewith at rest
and in peace; and the form should be animated by
the content of spiritual individuality. And so the
external sensuous matter is here no longer manipulated,
either in conformity with its mechanical quality
alone, as a mass possessing weight, nor in shapes
belonging to the inorganic world, nor as indifferent to
colour, etc.; but it is wrought in ideal forms of the
human figure, and, it must be remarked, in all three
spatial dimensions.</p>

<p>In this last respect we must claim for sculpture,
that it is in it that the inward and spiritual are first
revealed in their eternal repose and essential self-completeness.
To such repose and unity with itself
there can correspond only that external shape which
itself maintains its unity and repose. And this is
fulfilled by shape in its abstract spatiality.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The
spirit which sculpture represents is that which is solid
in itself, not broken up in the play of trivialities and
of passions; and hence its external form too is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
abandoned to any manifold phases of appearance,
but appears under this one aspect only, as the abstraction
of space in the whole of its dimensions.</p>

<p>(&gamma;) Now, after architecture has erected the temple,
and the hand of sculpture has supplied it with the
statue of the God, then, in the third place, this god
present to sense is confronted in the spacious halls
of his house by the <i>community</i>. The community is
the spiritual reflection into itself of such sensuous
existence, and is the animating subjectivity and
inner life which brings about the result that the
determining principle for the content of art, as well
as for the medium which represents it in outward
form, comes to be particularization [dispersion into
various shapes, attributes, incidents, etc.], individualization,
and the subjectivity which they require.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
The solid unity which the God has in sculpture breaks
up into the multitudinous inner lives of individuals,
whose unity is not sensuous, but purely ideal.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>It is only in this stage that God Himself comes
to be really and truly spirit&mdash;the spirit in His (God's)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
community; for He here begins to be a to-and-fro, an
alternation between His unity within himself and his
realization in the individual's knowledge and in its
separate being, as also in the common nature and
union of the multitude. In the community, God is
released from the abstractness of unexpanded self-identity,
as well as from the simple absorption in a
bodily medium, by which sculpture represents Him.
And He is thus exalted into spiritual existence and
into knowledge, into the reflected<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> appearance which
essentially displays itself as inward and as subjectivity.
Therefore the higher content is now the
spiritual nature, and that in its absolute shape. But
the dispersion of which we have spoken reveals this
at the same time as particular spiritual being, and as
individual character. Now, what manifests itself in
this phase as the main thing is not the serene quiescence
of the God in Himself, but appearance as
such, being which is <i>for</i> another, self-manifestation.
And hence, in the phase we have reached, all the
most manifold subjectivity in its living movement
and operation&mdash;as human passion, action, and incident,
and, in general, the wide realm of human feeling, will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and its negation,&mdash;is for its own sake the object of
artistic representation. In conformity with this
content, the sensuous element of art has at once to
show itself as made particular in itself and as adapted
to subjective inwardness. Media that fulfil this
requirement we have in colour, in musical sound,
and finally in sound as the mere indication of inward
perceptions and ideas; and as modes of
realizing the import in question by help of these
media we obtain painting, music, and poetry. In
this region the sensuous medium displays itself as
subdivided in its own being and universally set
down as ideal.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Thus it has the highest degree of
conformity with the content of art, which, as such,
is spiritual, and the connection of intelligible import
and sensuous medium develops into closer intimacy
than was possible in the case of architecture and
sculpture. The unity attained, however, is a more
inward unity, the weight of which is thrown wholly
on the subjective side, and which, in as far as form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and content are compelled to particularize themselves
and give themselves merely ideal existence, can only
come to pass at the expense of the objective universality
of the content and also of its amalgamation
with the immediately sensuous element.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The arts, then, of which form and content exalt
themselves to ideality, abandon the character of
symbolic architecture and the classical ideal of
sculpture, and therefore borrow their type from the
romantic form of art, whose mode of plasticity they
are most adequately adapted to express. And they
constitute a <i>totality</i> of arts, because the romantic
type is the most concrete in itself.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>i. The articulation of this <i>third sphere</i> of the individual
arts may be determined as follows. The <i>first</i>
art in it, which comes next to sculpture, is painting.
It employs as a medium for its content and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
plastic embodiment of that content visibility as such
in as far as it is specialized in its own nature, <i>i.e.</i> as
developed into colour. It is true that the material
employed in architecture and sculpture is also visible
and coloured; but it is not, as in painting, visibility
as such, not the simple light which, differentiating
itself in virtue of its contrast with darkness, and in
combination with the latter, gives rise to colour.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
This quality of visibility, made subjective in itself
and treated as ideal, needs neither, like architecture,
the abstractly mechanical attribute of mass as
operative in the properties of heavy matter, nor,
like sculpture, the complete sensuous attributes of
space, even though concentrated into organic shapes.
The visibility and the rendering visible which belong
to painting have their differences in a more ideal
form, in the several kinds of colour, and they liberate
art from the sensuous completeness in space which
attaches to material things, by restricting themselves
to a plane surface.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the content also attains the
most comprehensive specification. Whatever can
find room in the human heart, as feeling, idea, and
purpose; whatever it is capable of shaping into act&mdash;all
this diversity of material is capable of entering
into the varied content of painting. The whole realm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of particular existence, from the highest embodiment
of mind down to the most isolated object of nature,
finds a place here. For it is possible even for finite
nature,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> in its particular scenes and phenomena, to
make its appearance in the realm of art, if only some
allusion to an element of mind endows it with
affinity to thought and feeling.</p>

<p>ii. The <i>second</i> art in which the romantic type
realizes itself is contrasted with painting, and is music.
Its medium, though still sensuous, yet develops into
still more thorough subjectivity and particularization.
Music, too, treats the sensuous as ideal, and does so by
negating,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and idealizing into the individual isolation
of a single point, the indifferent externality<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> of space,
whose complete semblance is accepted and imitated
by painting. The single point, <i>qua</i> such a negativity
(excluding space) is in itself a concrete and active
process of positive negation<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> within the attributes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
matter, in the shape of a motion and tremor of the
material body within itself and in its relation to itself.
Such an inchoate ideality of matter,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> which appears
no longer as under the form of space, but as temporal
ideality,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> is sound, the sensuous set down as negated,
with its abstract visibility converted into audibility,
inasmuch as sound, so to speak, liberates the ideal
content from its immersion in matter. This earliest
inwardness of matter and inspiration of soul into it
furnishes the medium for the mental inwardness&mdash;itself
as yet indefinite,&mdash;and for the soul<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> into which
mind concentrates itself; and finds utterance in its
tones for the heart with its whole gamut of feelings
and passions. Thus music forms the centre of the
romantic arts, just as sculpture represents the central
point between architecture and the arts of romantic
subjectivity. Thus, too, it forms the point of transition
between abstract spatial sensuousness, such as
painting employs, and the abstract spirituality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
poetry. Music has within itself, like architecture, a
relation of quantity conformable to the understanding,
as the antithesis to emotion and inwardness; and has
also as its basis a solid conformity to law on the part
of the tones, of their conjunction, and of their succession.</p>

<p>iii. most spiritual mode
of representation of the romantic art-type, we must
look for it in <i>poetry</i>. Its characteristic peculiarity lies
in the power with which it subjects to the mind and
to its ideas the sensuous element from which music
and painting in their degree began to liberate art.
For sound, the only external matter which poetry
retains, is in it no longer the feeling of the sonorous
itself, but is a <i>sign</i>, which by itself is void of import.
And it is a sign of the idea which has become concrete
in itself and not merely of indefinite feeling and
of its <i>nuances</i> and grades. This is how sound develops
into the <i>Word</i>, as voice articulate in itself,
whose import it is to indicate ideas and notions.
The merely negative point up to which music had
developed now makes its appearance as the completely
concrete point, the point which is mind, the
self-conscious individual, which, producing out of itself
the infinite space of its ideas, unites it with the temporal
character of sound. Yet this sensuous element, which
in music was still immediately one with inward feeling,
is in poetry separated from the content of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
consciousness. In poetry the mind determines this
content for its own sake, and apart from all else,
into the shape of ideas, and though it employs sound
to express them, yet treats it solely as a symbol
without value or import. Thus considered, sound
may just as well be reduced to a mere letter, for the
audible, like the visible, is thus depressed into a mere
indication of mind.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> For this reason the proper
medium of poetical representation is the poetical
imagination and intellectual portrayal itself. And as
this element is common to all types of art, it follows
that poetry runs through them all and develops itself
independently in each. Poetry is the universal art of
the mind which has become free in its own nature,
and which is not tied to find its realization in external
sensuous matter, but expatiates exclusively in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
inner space and inner time of the ideas and feelings.
Yet just in this its highest phase art ends by transcending
itself, inasmuch as it abandons the medium
of a harmonious embodiment of mind in sensuous
form, and passes from the poetry of imagination into
the prose of thought.</p>

<p>5. Such we may take to be the articulated totality
of the particular arts, viz. the external art of architecture,
the objective art of sculpture, and the
subjective art of painting music and poetry. Many
other classifications have been attempted, for a
work of art presents so many aspects, that, as has
often been the case, first one and then another is
made the basis of classification. For instance, one
might take the sensuous medium. Thus architecture
is treated as crystallization; sculpture, as the organic
modelling of the material in its sensuous and spatial
totality; painting, as the coloured surface and line;
while in music, space, as such, passes into the point of
time possessed of content within itself, until finally the
external medium is in poetry depressed into complete
insignificance. Or, again, these differences have been
considered with reference to their purely abstract
attributes of space and time. Such abstract peculiarities
of works of art may, like their material
medium, be consistently explored in their characteristic
traits; but they cannot be worked out as the
ultimate and fundamental law, because any such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
aspect itself derives its origin from a higher principle,
and must therefore be subordinate thereto.</p>

<p>This higher principle we have found in the types of
art&mdash;symbolic, classical, and romantic&mdash;which are the
universal stages or elements<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> of the Idea of beauty
itself. For <i>symbolic art</i> attains its most adequate
reality and most complete application in <i>architecture</i>,
in which it holds sway in the full import of its notion,
and is not yet degraded to be, as it were, the inorganic
nature dealt with by another art. The <i>classical</i>
type of art, on the other hand, finds adequate realization
in sculpture, while it treats architecture only as
furnishing an enclosure in which it is to operate, and
has not acquired the power of developing painting
and music as absolute<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> forms for its content. The
<i>romantic</i> type of art, finally, takes possession of painting
and music, and in like manner of poetic representation,
as substantive and unconditionally adequate
modes of utterance. Poetry, however, is conformable
to all types of the beautiful, and extends over them
all, because the artistic imagination is its proper
medium, and imagination is essential to every product
that belongs to the beautiful, whatever its type
may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>And, therefore, what the particular arts realize in
individual works of art, are according to their abstract
conception simply the universal types which constitute
the self-unfolding Idea of beauty. It is as the external
realization of this Idea that the wide Pantheon of
art is being erected, whose architect and builder is the
spirit of beauty as it awakens to self-knowledge, and
to complete which the history of the world will need
its evolution of ages.</p>

God is conceived to have reality. On this see below, p. 165. It
appears certain to me that Hegel, when he writes thus, is
referring to the self-consciousness of individual human beings
as constituting, and reflecting on, an ideal unity between them.
This may seem to put a non-natural meaning on the term
"person" or "subject," as if the common element of a number
of intelligences could be a single person. It is obvious that
the question hinges on the degree in which a unity that is
not sensuous but ideal can be effective and actual. I can
only say here, that the more we consider the nature of ideal
unity the higher we shall rate its capabilities. See Prefatory
Essay, p. xiv.</p>

compare, <i>e.g.</i>, a Teniers with a Greek statue, or again, say, a
Turner with the same. "Subjectivity" means that the work
of art appeals to our ordinary feelings, experiences, etc. Music
and poetry are still stronger cases than painting, according to
the theory. Poetry especially can deal with <i>everything</i>.</p>

or made <i>to be</i> in the sense of <i>not being</i>; e.g. musical sound is
"ideal" as existing, <i>qua</i> work of art, in memory only, the
moment in which it is actually heard being fugitive; a picture,
in respect of the third dimension, which has to be read into it;
and poetry is almost wholly ideal, <i>i.e.</i> uses hardly any sensuous
element, but appeals almost entirely to what exists <i>in the mind</i>.
"Subdivided," "<i>besondert</i>," like "<i>particularisirt</i>" above; because
of the variety and diversity present in the mere material
of colours, musical sounds, and ideas.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_171_171" id="Footnote_171_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_171_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> Again, the subject of a Turner or Teniers is not objectively
universal, in the simplest sense; not something that is actually
and literally the same everywhere and for every one. And both
painting and music (immediately sensuous elements) are less
completely amalgamated with the ideal, represent it less solidly
and thoroughly than the statue, so far as the ideal is itself
external or plastic.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_172_172" id="Footnote_172_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> The greater affinity of Romantic art with the movement
and variety of the modern spirit displays itself not only in the
greater flexibility of painting, music, or poetry, as compared with
architecture and sculpture, but in the fact that the Romantic
type contains these three arts at least, while the Symbolic and
Classical types had only one art each.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_173_173" id="Footnote_173_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> This is drawn from Goethe's doctrine of colour, which
Hegel unfortunately adopted in opposition to Newton's theory.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_175_175" id="Footnote_175_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> "<i>Aufheben</i>," used pregnantly by Hegel to mean <i>both</i> "cancel,"
"annul," <i>and</i>, "preserve," "fix in mind," "idealize." The use
of this word is a cardinal point of his dialectic. See "Wiss. der
Logik.," i. 104. I know of no equivalent but "put by," provincial
Scotch "put past." The negation of space is an attribute of
music. The parts of a chord are no more in space than are
the parts of a judgment. Hegel expresses this by saying that
music idealizes space and concentrates it into a point.</p>

of a sonorous body, its extension, only appears in its sound indirectly,
or inferentially, by modifying the nature of the sound.
It is, therefore, "idealized."</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_179_179" id="Footnote_179_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179_179"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> Succession in time is a degree more "ideal" than co-existence
in space, because it exists solely in the medium of
memory.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_180_180" id="Footnote_180_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_180_180"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> "<i>Seele</i>:" mind on its individual side, as a particular feeling
subject. "<i>Geist</i>" is rather mind as the common nature of
intelligence. Thus in feeling and self-feeling, mind is said to
concentrate itself into a soul.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_181_181" id="Footnote_181_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_181_181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> Hegel seems to accept this view. Was he insensible to
sound in poetry? Some very grotesque verses of his, preserved
in his biography, go to show that his ear was not sensitive.
Yet his critical estimate of poetry is usually just. Shakespeare
and Sophocles were probably his favourites. And, as a matter
of proportion, what he here says is true. It must be remembered
that the beauty of sound in poetry is to a great extent
indirect, being supplied by the passion or emotion which the
ideas symbolized by the sounds arouse. The beauty of poetical
sound in itself <i>is</i> very likely less than often supposed. It must
have the capacity for receiving passionate expression; but that
is not the same as the sensuous beauty of a note or a colour. If
the words used in a noble poem were divested of all meaning,
they would lose much, though not all, of the beauty of their
sound.</p>

phrase for the stages which form the essential parts or factors of
any idea. They make their appearance successively, but the
earlier are implied and retained in the later.</p>
